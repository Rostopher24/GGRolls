// Hailing Confusion
dimwishlist:item=-2870169846&perks=839105230,1885400500,2387244414,4267945040#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst it lacks a damage perk, this is one of the most consistent neutral game pulses in the game. Zen Moment makes it a laser beam as you deal damage, and Full Auto keeps you firing at the optimal rate. Hold on to this one, as it's one of the few good rolls on this weapon.

Auto-Loading is great on MGs, bypassing their lengthy reload animations, and One for All is basically free on MGs; particularly with Armor-Piercing, which can get multiple hits with one bullet, proccing one for all faster. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=3325778512&perks=839105230,2420895100,3300816228,4049631843#notes:Rostopher: Finally, a 450 RPM solar MG that doesn't look ridiculous! Or not. Anyway, this is a great PvE pick. Auto-loading is great on MGs, particularly in combination with Extended Mag, as you bypass the slow reload, and get 69 (nice) bullets in the mag. Arrowhead Brake keeps the weapon under control, and One for All is basically free to proc on MGs, for a massive damage boost. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=3325778512&perks=839105230,2420895100,1820235745,4104185692#notes:Rostopher: Finally, a 450 RPM solar MG that doesn't look ridiculous! Or not. Anyway, this is a great PvE pick. Because of the massive magazine from Extended Mag, Subsistence works really well here, and Frenzy being both a damage and reload perk really helps in the unlikely event that you do need to reload. Arrowhead Brake keeps the weapon under control. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// A Sudden Death
dimwishlist:item=2855157553&perks=466087222,3142289711,3161816588,3142289711#notes:The Warmind: PvP pick. The key to securing kills at 'long' ranges (for a shotgun, so 6-7 metres) with an aggressive frame shotgun is your range stat, regardless of any pellet-spread altering perks, and you want to achieve the maximum possible range you can with these weapons. This combination of barrel and magazine perks has done that as far as perks can, and you also have here two excellent perks for PvP in columns 3 and 4. Keep! [Recommended MW: Range]

// Abide the Return
dimwishlist:item=1644160541&perks=3666208348,269888150,1749209109,2726471870#notes:Rostopher: Abide the Return…returns, and it brings with it a slightly inferior perk package than it had before. That said, it's one of only a handful of swords that can roll thresh, and that has a fair amount of value, and this one is a 4/4 keeper.
dimwishlist:item=1644160541&perks=3666208348,269888150,2590710093,2726471870#notes:Rostopher: Abide the Return…returns, and it brings with it a slightly inferior perk package than it had before.

That said, it's one of only a handful of swords that can roll thresh, and that has a fair amount of value. Whilst this isn't THE roll - you want both Swordmaster's Guard and Jagged edge - this'll do until you get it.

// Accrued Redemption
dimwishlist:item=4095896073&perks=852209214,3827198035,201365942,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: This is the discerning bow-users roll. Buffs to accuracy from the string and arrow perks, alongside the classic Archer's Tempo/Rampage combo. This bow is rare as hell, and this is a perfect roll on it, so whack a rampage spec on it, and keep it. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Adored
dimwishlist:item=4184808992&perks=3250034553,3142289711,3400784728,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: Adored is a great generalist sniper - Triple Tap and Vorpal makes it potent in PvE (though better snipers are available, though not in Arc flavour), and Killing Wind/Snapshot makes it excellent in PvP. A keeper for sure.

// Age-Old Bond
dimwishlist:item=601592879&perks=1467527085,679225683,1354429876,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Whilst 360 autos aren't exactly optimal weapons, this curated roll works just fine. It's got a ton of range, so can be useful for cracking void shields at range, and pairs really nicely with Anti-Barrier Auto Rifle when it's on the artefact. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Ancient Gospel
dimwishlist:item=48643186&perks=4090651448,106909392,1168162263,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Ancient Gospel is a great little hand cannon that'll do work wherever hand cannons are good. This roll is fully min/maxed to do work for you, with Outlaw and Kill Clip providing a lovely synergistic pairing, and Tactical Mag bumping up your magazine size and reducing your reload speed, to minimise your downtime. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=48643186&perks=1482024992,3142289711,699525795,2846385770#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 140s are almost always a competitive pick, particularly if you have the aim to let them sing, and this roll will do work for you at plenty of ranges. Eye of the Storm is an underrated perk for PvP, increasing your bullet magnetism as your health gets lower, which might give you the edge you need in a duel. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Apex Predator
dimwishlist:item=2545083870&perks=3525010810,3796465595,3977735242,3300816228#notes:Rostopher: Apex Predator is the runt of the rocket launcher family. It's perk selection is microscopic, its curated roll is weird at the best of times and it has largely been superseded by Code Duello. However, if you do have this particular roll, this is probably the absolute min-maxed DPS roll you can get, so hold onto it. [Recommended MW: Velocity]

// Apostate
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=839105230,106909392,1556840489,3038247973#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick for this otherwise mediocre weapon. Arrowhead sorts out the vaguely bizarre recoil direction, with Tac Mag bumping up your stability, reload speed and mag size to acceptable ranges. Lead from Gold will keep you stocked up, and Explosive Payload is the only perk that increases damage per shot, rather than per kill. Half-decent, but Adored or Occluded Finality have much better PvE rolls available. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=4090651448,3142289711,2866798147,47981717#notes:Rostopher: If you're mad enough to want to use this weapon in PvP, this is probably the best roll you can find. Bear in mind that you'll need, count 'em, THREE body shots to kill a guardian if you miss the headshot, so make sure you're landing those headshots, and with this roll, it's just a little bit more forgiving to do so. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=1840239774,3142289711,2866798147,47981717#notes:Rostopher: If you're mad enough to want to use this weapon in PvP, this is probably the best roll you can find. Bear in mind that you'll need, count 'em, THREE body shots to kill a guardian if you miss the headshot, so make sure you're landing those headshots, and with this roll, it's just a little bit more forgiving to do so. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Arc Logic
dimwishlist:item=2723909519&perks=839105230,3142289711,1570042021,3592538738#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 600s still do work in PvP, and Arc Logic is a fairly typical 600. Being arc is great against pesky Heir Apparent users too. Arrowhead will help keep your weapon under control, Accurized pushes your effective range out to 24 metres, and Heating Up makes you more and more accurate as you rack up the kills. Normally I'd recommend a damage perk, but both those available on this weapon are difficult to proc in PvP, so Wellspring naturally steps up to the plate, being extremely solid for your neutral game. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=2723909519&perks=839105230,106909392,2450788523,4104185692#notes:Rostopher: PvE Pick. Arc Logic is back, and whilst in principle it's just an arc Gnawing Hunger, it's recoil tends a little more strongly to the left, so may feel a bit odd in comparison. Arrowhead Brake on this roll sorts that out somewhat, and Tac Mag is the GOAT PvE mag choice. Frenzy being a reload and damage perk in one opens up your column 3 for a utility pick, and Killing Wind is absolutely the best of those available for PvE. [Recommended MW: Reload]

// Archon's Thunder
dimwishlist:item=1967303408&perks=839105230,106909392,3513791699,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: This here is the best roll available on this weapon. Arrowhead Brake sorts out its weird recoil pattern, Tactical Mag buffs the magazine size, reload speed and stability, and Mulligan/Rampage is a pretty tasty combo for those of us who like to shoot but sometimes miss things. [Recommended MW: Reload]

// Arctic Haze
dimwishlist:item=20935540&perks=4090651448,106909392,2450788523,2848615171#notes:Rostopher: Generalist PvE pick. Corkscrew Rifling is the best all-rounder barrel option, buffing stability, handling and range all at once; Tac Mag bumps your magazine size, stability and reload speed. Killing Wind/Dragonfly is a great perk combo for low-end content, keeping you mobile and exploding big crowds of enemies. [Recommended MW: Reload]
dimwishlist:item=20935540&perks=4090651448,106909392,3400784728,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: Min/Maxed PvE pick. Corkscrew Rifling is the best all-rounder barrel option, buffing stability, handling and range all at once; Tac Mag bumps your magazine size, stability and reload speed; and Triple Tap/Vorpal will see you burning down Yellow Bars and bosses in a beautifully efficient champion. Particularly good with Anti-Barrier Auto Rifle, but will do work without it as well. [Recommended MW: Reload]
dimwishlist:item=20935540&perks=3250034553,3142289711,2450788523,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Maximised range, with Killing Wind pushing it out even further upon kill and keeping you moving, and Vorpal Weapon allowing you to burn down supers surprisingly quickly. Don't sleep on this weapon. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Arsenic Bite-4b
dimwishlist:item=720351795&perks=852209214,3429800428,3425386926,201365942#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. The OG energy bow, the combo of Archer's Tempo and Rampage is a thing of beauty. Fiberglass Arrows max out your accuracy, and Polymer String gets your draw time down as far as possible, maximising your damage potential. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Astral Horizon
dimwishlist:item=1697682876&perks=1300023272,791862061,3300816228,2360754333#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Not that you'll likely use this weapon in PvE, but if you do happen upon this roll, it does do a fair amount of work (for example, it can 1-tap Oracles in Vault of Glass). Auto-Loading holster pairs very nicely with Trench Barrell, Assault Mag ramps up your fire rate, and Barrel Shroud gives you the biggest possible bump to handling, making sure you can whip it out quickly. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=1697682876&perks=1332244541,3142289711,3436462433,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Maximised range, bonus accuracy on the first shot of your attack, and a bump to handling from Surplus. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Astral Horizon (Adept)
dimwishlist:item=532746994&perks=1300023272,791862061,3300816228,2360754333#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick.

// Bad Omens
dimwishlist:item=991314988&perks=1478423395,3796465595,3977735242,1275731761#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Bad Omens is a lovely rocket launcher that has, sadly been largely superseded by the superior Royal Entry. That said, this roll will be entirely functional at Blowing Shit Up™.  This is also the curated roll, so always worth hanging on to it. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Bequest
dimwishlist:item=3366545721&perks=1261178282,269888150,2726471870,354401740#notes:Gravy: For nearly 3 seasons, I passed this weapon off as no more than a Weeb sword. However, after seeing SneakyBeaver gushing over this thing, I had to try it out. Oh, my, goodness! I don't know why but it just feels great. Great damage, great ammo reserves and more super energy than you can shake a stick at (or whatever the phrase is). Give this thing a try, and become the Weeb you were meant to be! [Recommended MW: Impact]
dimwishlist:item=3366545721&perks=3666208348,269888150,1749209109,354401740#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Holding the dubious honour of 'Perhaps most disappointing raid weapon', Bequest is a weapon that is very much style over substance. That said, Relentless Strikes and Assassin's Blade will be entirely functional in low-end content. Swordmaster's gets your heavy attack back faster, and Jagged Edge maximises your damage potential. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3366545721&perks=3666208348,269888150,2726471870,354401740#notes:Gravy: For nearly 3 seasons, I passed this weapon off as no more than a Weeb sword.

dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=4090651448,3142289711,957782887,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat contentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]

dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=3250034553,3142289711,957782887,588594999#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat contentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Biting Winds
dimwishlist:item=1621657423&perks=852209214,3827198035,2450788523,3350417888#notes:Rostopher: Biting Winds is a bit of an odd duck in the bow department. It's the only bow that cannot roll with Archer's Tempo, and so we must look elsewhere for utility. Killing Wind is rather good on pretty much everything, and Sympathetic Arsenal was designed for bows, given that you are always 'reloading' it when you nock an arrow. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]
dimwishlist:item=1621657423&perks=852209214,3827198035,247725512,4082225868#notes:Rostopher: Biting Winds is a bit of an odd duck in the bow department. It's the only bow that cannot roll with Archer's Tempo, and Rapid Hit feels like a poor replacement. However, this roll still gets the job done, and as a bonus, you can punch a guy for a big stack of damage boost. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Blasphemer
dimwishlist:item=2782847179&perks=3250034553,3142289711,706527188,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. The curated roll of this weapon is a monstrous contender in PvP. If you like slug shotguns therein, you'll like this one. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Bonechiller
dimwishlist:item=4037745684&perks=1840239774,791862061,3300816228,3523296417#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst it's no First In, Last Out, this weapon still holds its own in PvE with this super interesting roll. Fire 6 shots, reload by throwing your grenade, fire 6 more, then stow it to let auto-loading kick in. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=4037745684&perks=1840239774,791862061,3400784728,3523296417#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst it's no First In, Last Out, this weapon still holds its own in PvE with this super interesting roll. Triple Tap lets you fire 7 shots before needing to reload, and reload you can with yeeting a grenade, for a total of 14 shots and your grenade damage in sweet sweet DPS. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=4037745684&perks=3250034553,3142289711,280464955,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst Bonechiller isn't as highly regarded as First In, Last Out or Blasphemer in PvP, this roll will work exceptionally well, particularly if you’re a sliding shotgun ape. Firmly Planted kicks in when you slide, then combines with the max range and opening shot to get unreasonably accurate murder. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Borrowed Time
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=839105230,1968497646,3643424744,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE god tier pick. Arrowhead makes the weapon incredibly controllable, Armor-Piercing makes the weapon do even more damage to shields, and will clean-up waves of weaker adds in a jiffy. Overflow is terrific on almost anything it rolls on, and the classic Rampage to round out the package. If you got this, you're enormously  lucky! Lock it and keep it. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=4090651448,1885400500,2450788523,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvP god tier pick. More or less maxed range, stability also maxed out - this thing hits for maximum damage at 18 meters, and Killing Wind will push that out even further. One stack of rampage reduces your TTK by 1 shot down to 7c1b/0.6 seconds as well. If you snagged this and like PvP, absolutely keep it. It'll do work in PvE too! [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=3250034553,1561002382,2846385770,4104185692#notes:Rostopher: Rostopher's personal roll. This weapon will absolutely surprise you, in both PvE and PvP, thanks to its 21 metre range, and the chunky damage buff from Frenzy. Hi-Cal makes it stagger targets more easily, and flinches opposing guardians in PvP something fierce. Give it a try, you might just fall in love with it. [Recommended MW: Range or Handling]

// Bottom Dollar
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=4090651448,2420895100,1820235745,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Subsistence combined with Extended Mag is the only way Subsistence really works on this weapon - ensuring you get 2 bullets back instead of 1, you can basically fire it forever in low-end content. Each stack of Rampage will make sure that you're definitely killing everything in front of you, so you may never need to reload ever. Do note that this weapon will likely perform poorly in higher tier content - it's a red-bar slayer and not much more.
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=4090651448,106909392,1168162263,2458213969#notes:Rostopher: God tier roll here. Corkscrew Rifling gives you a flat buff to 3 stats with no downsides; Tac Mag gives you an extra bullet and a bonus to reload and stability; and Outlaw/Multi-Kill Clip is a perfectly synergistic 3rd and 4th. This thing hits like a train in both PvE and PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=3250034553,3142289711,2450788523,47981717#notes:Rostopher: An insane max-range roll for PvP here. You're sacrificing a damage perk for Opening Shot, but if you can combine it with High Energy Fire or other damage buffs, this thing has insane two-tap range, and is outrageously consistent in duels. [Recommended MW: Range]

With Frenzy, you don't really need a reload perk, as Frenzy IS a reload perk, so Killing Wind is the almost obvious replacement for Feeding Frenzy or Rapid Hit, pushing your range out ludicrously, and giving you the zoomies in the process. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Aggressive Burst sidearms are hugely underrated in PvP, and Brass Attacks with this roll absolutely slaps. Rampage lowers your already ridiculously low TTK, and Killing Wind lets you compete at nearly auto-rifle ranges. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Corkscrew and Accurized will push your range out to 23 meters, and Dynamic Sway will keep the weapon from bouncing around too hard. Proccing Kill Clip will drop your TTK to .60 for the duration, so is not to be sniffed at. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Corkscrew and Accurized will push your range out to 23 meters. Kill Clip and Tunnel Vision are curiously synergistic, proccing on reloading after a kill, so you can just beam the next guy after securing a kill. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Feeding Frenzy + Kill Clip is a lovely synergistic combo, giving you a huge bump to your already impressive DPS on this weapon. The flat buff to 3 stats from Corkscrew Rifling will keep the weapon under control, and Tactical Mag is always a great option on more or less any weapon. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Subsistence + Rampage is a quintessential add-clearing pick, and the massive magazine on this weapon means as long as your focusing on red-bars, you may never need to reload. Alloy Mag gives a lovely snappy reload if you do hit the bottom of the mag, and Polygonal's stability bump is a super welcome bump to the weapon's controllability. [Recommended MW: Any]

High-Cal pushes your range out and increases the already heft flinch that you'll be dishing out. Zen Moment will kick your reticule steady, and Headseeker will help you secure those two-burst kills.

Given that you are guaranteed to get less than half the magazine on heavy ammo pickup, you've got here a very dangerous weapon in PvP. Dynamic Sway Reduction will help keep you on target. This also features close to max range and stability, to keep you consistent and engaging at any given range in PvP. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Steadyhand goes a long way to offsetting the weapon's inherently poor handling and stability stats, with Accurized and Rangefinder doing the bulk of the work in the range department.

The poor handling stat is not well offset by the higher than average base aim assistance, with recoil that tends right as compared to the vast majority of other Aggressives, which tend to be left or straight.

Vorpal is exceptional on this weapon, turning it into a Super-melting machine in PvP, and performing really well in PvE, particularly in higher-end content when Scout Rifles are in the Champion meta. This roll maximises range without sacrificing handling, keeping the weapon snappy whilst pushing out the aim assist on the hip fire as far as possible. [Recommended MW: Any]

Corkscrew rifling and Composite Stock are probably best in slot options, and Armour Piercing does more damage to shields when you need it to. [Recommended MW: Any]

Whilst adaptives struggle to fill a niche in the PvP meta, Kickstart is strong enough to elevate their usual station. Combined with Slideways for bonus stability when you proc it, Liquid Coils to give you a de-facto range boost, and Arrowhead Brake (combined with a Counterbalance Mod) to keep the recoil under control, this weapon slides (see what I did there) into precision frame's territory.

Whilst adaptives struggle to fill a niche in the PvP meta, Cornered is a surprisingly good pick, and it's one of only a handful of fusions that can roll it, giving you a bonus to handling and charge time when 3 opponents are within 15 metres, which happens more than you think in PvP. Under Pressure is great in PvP, giving you bonus stability in the bottom half of the mag, which is more or less all the time in PvP. Liquid Coils gives you a de-facto range boost, and Arrowhead Brake (combined with a Counterbalance Mod) will keep the recoil under control. [Recommended MW: Range]

Whilst adaptives struggle to fill a niche in the PvP meta, Kickstart is strong enough to elevate their usual station. Combined with Under Pressure for bonus on the bottom half of the magazine (which you should be at more or less all the time in PvP), Liquid Coils to give you a de-facto range boost, and Arrowhead Brake (combined with a Counterbalance Mod) to keep the recoil under control, this weapon slides (see what I did there) into precision frame's territory.

Uniquely among fusion rifles, this weapon can roll Frenzy, which is both a reload and damage perk, which makes up for the weapon's lack of reload perks in column 3, so Lead from Gold is the perk that most naturally slots in for PvE. Ionized Battery gets you 8 shots in the mag, and with Frenzy active, these'll hit hard in low and mid-tier content. [Recommended MW: Reload]

Sidearms are somewhat underrated in PvE, particularly for low- to mid-tier add clear, and this weapon will do work in that regard. Full Auto removes problems surrounding the weapon's fire rate, and because you'll almost always be within punching distance of something, you can keep Swashbuckler up a lot of the time. Flared and Control SAS keep your weapon steady and the reload snappy. [Recommended MW: Handling or Reload]

Whilst Precision frames aren't quite as good as Lightweight or Adaptive sidearms, they do have a couple of things going for them over those two - namely a more forgiving TTK profile (2c2b), and extended base range. This weapon is absolutely maxed on range, can keep its optimal kill up to nearly 18 metres.

Tac Mag is the go-to pick for almost any weapon in PvE if it's available, providing flat buffs to mag size, stability and reload speed. Model 8 Red provides the most zoom, and therefore the most range. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Armor-Piercing ensures it's doing maximum damage to shields and barriers (and collateral kills are extremely fun to pull off), Overflow means you can get an enormous 32-round magazine, and Disruption Break renders targets vulnerable to kinetic damage, which benefits both you and your team.

Whilst this weapon is not quite as good as the similar Shayura's Wrath, it is distinctly easier to acquire (Shayura's being acquired from Trials, which… well it's Trials), and you have one of the best PvE rolls available on this weapon. Killing Wind is terrific in PvE for zipping into cover and dodging bullets, Multikill Clips is great, particularly in lower tier content. Corkscrew and Flared give you nice flat buffs to Reload Speed, Handling, Stability and Range, so will keep the weapon feeling snappy and consistent. [Recommended MW: Reload]

Whilst this weapon is not quite as good as the similar Trials weapon Shayura's Wrath, it is distinctly easier to acquire, the only downside being that it lacks the zoom that really pushes your range out on Shayura's. Still, this'll do at least a bit of work as a backup weapon to a sniper. Rangefinder, High-Cal and Hammer-Forged push out your range (to just over 20m with a Range masterwork), and just one stack of Multikill Clip drops your optimal TTK to 0.7 seconds, requiring one less precision shot for the kill.

The latter frees up your weapon for something like Icarus Grip, Quick Access Sling or Freehand Grip. The combination of Steadyhand and Ricochet puts your stability at 86, and with a Stability masterwork, it goes up to 95, which is outrageously easy to control on both M&K and controller.

Subsistence/Rampage is a terrific combination, with Rampage giving you better net return on each kill thanks to the increased damage. Tac Mag is a nice flat buff to Stability, Reload Speed and Mag Size, and Polygonal keeps your shot from bouncing all over the place like a lunatic. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Corkscrew Rifling does a nice flat buff to handling, stability and range, Light Mag keeps the reload snappy and pushes out your range; and Tunnel Vision locks your high-damage shots from Multi-Kill Clip onto the heads of your enemies. Thoroughly recommend, even if you don't like pulse rifles. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Whilst Hollow Words is not quite as good as the similar Plug One, it does have some small advantages over the nightfall weapon, such as its ability to roll Vorpal Weapon, which hey look! You got! Combined with Killing Wind and Liquid Coils, this thing has RANGE, particularly after securing the first kill. A keeper to be sure. [Recommended MW: Any except Charge Time]

Pull the sword out, unleash a single high-damage heavy attack, then stow it again for use later. If you secure a kill, every second kill will give you back some ammo, reducing its downtime. Look for Swordmaster's Guard, and more or less any blade perk.

Whilst damage perks are great in the chaos of 6s, this roll here is a terrific perk for when you're going to be engaged in duels and can't just scythe through a team. Rapid Hit makes landing shots after your first crit a little bit easier, and Moving Target provides a bump to the weapon's already generous aim assist, as well as letting you move faster when ADS-ing.

Whilst the S15 Fusion Rifle rework severely reduced High Impact fusion's ease of use in PvP, if you can get a grasp on the longer charge time, you can still secure kills at some fairly disgusting ranges with this weapon. Just remember to try and keep your magazine at 3 or less and you'll be getting more or less full benefit from your two primary perks here.

This weapon is unique in that it can roll Disruption Break in Column 3, where normally it lands in column 4, meaning it can be paired with Rampage to serve a dual role of shield cracking and red-bar slaying. Armor-Piercing makes it hit shields harder, and the SRO-52 is the best all-rounder scope, featuring high zoom but retaining visibility for situation awareness.

Pulse Rifles will almost always be an at least half-decent pick in PvP, being both range-y and easy to use. This one in particular can two-burst someone with just one stack of Rampage, and Zen Moment keeps your bursts on target, assuming you land the first shot.

Legal Action II is a low-key contender for one of the best pulses in the game, thanks to its rock solid base stats, and meaty 22 zoom, giving it a base range of just under 45m, which is a lot. The only reason this isn't better than the messenger is Desperado, that's it. Arrowhead Brake entirely straightens up the recoil and Accurized pushes your accuracy cone out even further. Heating Up and Rampage pair incredibly well, giving you a big damage boost and a more stable weapon upon securing a kill, making you more likely to secure another.

Whilst it may seem odd that I've selected the scope with the highest zoom, the Y4 changes to how sniper zoom affected aim assist means that on controller, high zoom is very much your friend, and even on M&K, if you can get to grips with the lowered field of view, this thing will land shots that you absolutely do not expect to.

Whilst better kinetic snipers are available, they are often harder to acquire, and this is an extremely solid pick for moments where you need one. Rapid Hit and Triple Tap synergise very well, allowing you to fire 7 rounds if you hit every crit before reloading lightning fast, even with deficit inflicted by Extended. ATC REX has the shortest zoom, giving you the best chance to track your target if they're moving. [Recommended MW: Reload or Handling]

Precision frames are probably my personal favourite type of fusion rifle for PvP. Whilst they lack the punch and forgivingness of high impacts, if you can stay on target, you'll be hugely rewarded.

Whilst a bit of an odd one out in the PvP shotgun stakes, Matador still has its place as a solid pick for PvP shotgunning. Opening Shot is the only perk capabable of actually moving your one-hit-kill range out further than the archetype's cap, and Perpetual Motion's handling boost is a reasonably good substitute for Snapshot Sights.

Combined with accurized rounds, this can touch up to 20 metres before damage drop-off. Killing Wind pushes that out even further when you secure a kill, and Kill Clip, when active, drops your TTK to a surreal 0.47 seconds, needing only 8 crits.

Thanks to the addition of the 'cleave' mechanic on swords, One for All is an astonishingly strong perk on them now. Providing a bigger damage bump than even relentless strikes, as long as you can hit at least three enemies, you then have 10 seconds to absolutely whale on the nearest big guy. You can absolutely scythe through waves of red and orange bars with this thing, do not sleep on it.

Combine Opening Shot with the disgustingly high zoom of this weapon, and you have a weapon that basically aims for you, and refunds ammo if you miss, it's wild.

Whilst generally speaking, if you need a solar rapid fire sniper rifle in high-difficulty content, you'll probably want to run the Ikelos sniper, if you're not running a warmind cell build, this is an entirely viable pick, particularly given that if you're using it as a shield-cracking weapon, you won't expend ammo doing so. Column 4 is a bit of a mixed bag for high-end content, but snapshot is probably the best pick, minimising the amount of time you're blind whilst scoping in for a shot.

Whilst this weapon isn't an optimal DPS weapon, and is largely outclassed by its Last Wish counterpart in that department, The Supremacy, this will be a great for sniping red- and orange-bar enemies in lower-tier content, particularly when there's a lot of them bunching up in groups.

If you're a crack shot (and you do need to be) this weapon will be extremely deadly in your hands. With among the lowest zoom, highest visibility scopes in the gap, combined with Snapshot, you'll always be able to keep a rough eye on your surroundings whilst you're scoping in to your target.

However, there are a few interesting rolls on it, and this is one of them. Dual Loader is usually a bit of a duff pick, but with Rapid Fire Frame's intrinsic fast reload (especially when the magazine is empty), it actually works pretty great for keeping your magazine filled. Trench Barrel is still great, even after it got nerfed to only affect 3 shots, and Tac Mag gets you to the magazine perk whilst buffing your reload speed. [Recommended MW: Handling or Reload]

If you do find yourself needing a shotgun in an activity that involves match game, this weapon can come in clutch, alloying to you have a third elemental weapon at your disposal. Lead from Gold will ensure you always have ammo, and Tac Mag with Barrel Shroud maxes your handling and magazine size, without hurting any of your other stats. [Recommended MW: Reload or Handling]

Whilst rapid-fire frames have never exactly been meta picks, they have always been viable as long as you commit to firing the second shot to secure the kill. Whilst this lacks snapshot, Thresh will push you ever closer to your super, which can help greatly if you're wanting to allocate armor stats to things other than intellect.

Extended, Accurized and Rangefinder push its range up to 17.5 metres (just under 18 if you have a Range MW), so in PvP, you'll surprise opponents with just how far out you can secure kills at your optimal TTK. Headstone is great in PvE, especially when paired with your stasis subclass and its various fragments and aspects, and can provide impromptu cover in PvP, which can provide the difference between winning and losing a 2v1.

FttC keeps your magazine topped up as you land precision hits, and Demolitionist lets you reload with a grenade throw, whilst topping up your grenade energy as you secure kills.

Whilst it takes a bit of effort to wind up, once you do get it going, this thing will take you right back to when Magnificent Howl twins were dominating the Crucible.

Whilst Frenzy is awkward at best on Snipers, it's 12% damage buff is not to be sniffed at, given that it's effectively the same damage bump as Vorpal Weapon. As such, this weapon can prove valuable in situations where you've got a significant amount of time to deal boss damage - fire another weapon for 12 seconds, then pull this guy out with Frenzy procced for a significant chunk of burst DPS.

Rewind Rounds effectively functions as a more forgiving Triple Tap, allowing you land body shots but still see a return, which can prove invaluable for targets that wiggle around. High-Impact Reserves will give you bonus damage on those returned rounds too, mean the weapon's damage ramps up fairly signficantly the more shots you land. Tac Mag is the best way to hit the magazine cap on the weapon, and Arrowhead Brake keeps it under control, significantly controlling the recoil and giving you a nice bump to handling.

Whilst 140 snipers have somewhat fallen out of favour, given that they require 3 body shots to kill a target, making them deeply unforgiving weapons if you fail to land the headshot. That said, if you are a confident sniper, this roll is capable of doing some work. Moving Target and Opening Shot together effectively max out your aim assist value on the first shot of your attack, freeing up your mod slot for something like Icarus Grip or Sprint Grip. Accurized pushes your accuracy cone out even further, making your aim assist work at longer ranges, and Fluted Barrel pushes your Handling up to 86, which will keep the weapon feeling snappy even without Snapshot Sights.

Whilst High-Impact pulses aren't exactly a popular pick, this is a fantastic roll of this weapon for low- and mid-tier content.

High Impact pulses are kinda nuts in PvP, capable of two-bursting without any assistance from damage perks, as long as you land all crits.

Extended Barrel bumps out your range and almost entirely straightens up your recoil, Armor-Piercing does more damage against shielded combatants and again pushes out your range, Rangefinder increases your zoom, giving you ~1.5m of extra effective range, and Frenzy serves as your catchall damage, reload and handling booster. An absolute keeper. [Recommended MW: Stability or Range]

This is not a sword that you take into high-difficulty content, and given that fact, this roll is absolutely terrific for lower-end PvE. Run at the nearest cloud of hurt, and go ham. Once you secure a kill, you've got a chainable 15% damage buff, allowing you to, y'know, kill more things. It's not quite as impactful as One for All, but it only requires a single kill, which makes it a little more forgiving. Tireless Blade will return ammo to you for heavy attack kills, and given the weapon's wild area of effect, you'll often be able to secure multiple kills with a single stroke. Enduring ramps your ammo count all the way to maximum, and you can increase it even further with backup mag.

Pellet shotguns will struggle to find a place in high-end PvE compared to slugs, and with that in mind, this is a lovely little red-bar slayer. You'll almost always be in range of something to punch, and if you secure the kill, you'll be rewarded with a big damage buff, that'll let you secure a bunch of kills to wind up Feeding Frenzy, which'll then let you reload your magazine in speedy fashion.

Whilst 180 scouts aren't exactly the most popular pick, given that 200s exist, they do have the slight advantage of more damage per hit, and slightly longer range, which can prove useful in a variety of situations. That and the aesthetic of this weapon is lovely, and it feels terrific to fire. This roll in particular is a strong one - Full Auto keeps you firing at the optimal rate, and Multi-Kill Clip is a perk that can feed into its own momentum, effective in both PvE and PvP.

Whilst 450 pulses have fallen out of favour since their Forsaken glory days, they can still do at least some work in PvP, and this roll here is a cracking one. Rangefinder maximises your effective range at over 40m, and High-Cal rounds will increase the weapon's already significant inflicted flinch. Arrowhead Brake keeps the weapon under control, and proccing Kill Clip will make the weapon's already forgiving TKK profile even more so, allowing you to secure a kill with only 4 precision hits and 2 body hits, and considering you fire 4 bullets with one trigger pull, I'm sure you can do the maths as to why that's hugely valuable.

Fluted bumps up your intrinsically low handling to acceptable levels, as well as giving a slight stabilty bump.

In harder content, it becomes increasingly difficult to land successive strikes on targets, making the usual god roll on swords of Relentless/Whirlwind less and less useful. So this here is an excellent alternative to that.

My personal PvP roll of this weapon, and whilst it's probably never gonna light up the Crucible like it did in the auto-rifle meta of Summer '20, it's still an extremely consistent, reliable roll of the weapon. As long as you're hitting your shots, it can duel effectively with handcannons within their range, and can outduel them outside of it, and is also surprisingly good at close range if you find yourself hip-firing it. Lock it, love it. [Recommended MW: Stability or Range]

Multi-Kill Clip is surprisingly effective on 600s, even with just one stack. Dynamic sway reduction keeps your bullets on target, and accurized lets you hit at unexpected ranges for an AR.

Feeding Frenzy and MKC synergise nicely, so this would be an all-round extremely solid roll for PvE. [Recommended MW: Stability]

With a range masterwork, it can touch up to 40m before damage drop-off, and Fourth Time's the Charm combined with Swash does a surprising amount of work in GMs when autos are in the champ meta. Even in lower-end content, it's still great fun to use, capable of firing up to 83 shots as long as you're landing your crits. Lock it, love it. [Recommended MW: Range]

Whilst 150 scouts are a little bit of a duff pick in PvE, this does have a couple of things going for it that elevate it to a decent pick for low-to-mid-tier content. One for All is the largest perk damage buff in the game (a whopping 35% for tagging three enemies); Rapid Hit keeps the weapon stable and the reload snappy, and Armor-Piercing will have it make short work of shielded opponents too. You have the best scope also, so this is definitely one to hold on to. [Recommended MW: Handling]

Whilst 150 scouts are a little bit of a duff pick in PvE, they do gel well with scout rifle anti-champion mods, particularly anti-barrier.

Killing Wind is underrated in PvE, keeping you mobile which helps you avoid incoming fire, and pushing out your range so you can continue shooting as you escape, and Multi-Kill clip ramps up your damage output upon reloading after successive kills.

Subsistence with any damage perk is great, as the less bullets you need to secure a kill, the more effective the returned bullets from Subsistence are when you do. One for All is one of the largest damage buffs in the game, giving you a 35% buff for simply tagging 3 different enemies. When it's procced, just murder everything in front of you.

Adaptive frame sidearms are criminally under-rated in PvP - featuring a ludicrously speedy 0.6s TTK, which this particular roll can hit up to 16 metres out the gate, thanks to Ricochet and Hammer-Forged. Secure a kill, and Killing Wind will push that out another 2 metres. Vorpal allows you to cook supers, too. Pair it with a rangier weapon like a bow, scout or sniper rifle, and go to town.

Just hold down the trigger, only pausing to reload to proc Kill Clip, and almost everything in front of you will die. This is also a terrific shield-cracking, by way of Armor-Piercing Rounds, and you've got the scope that pushes its range out the furthest, so if sidearms are your jam, this is a masterwork for you.

Rangefinder and Moving Target is a fairly classic pairing on a sidearm for PvP, allowing you to secure kills much further out than the enemy might expect. Moving Target gives you a nice aim assist bonus, whilst also keeping you mobile whilst ADS-ing. Look to pair it with scope and magazine perks that enhance your range or stability as far as possible.

Arrowhead Brake sorts out its weird recoil pattern, and Mulligan/Rampage is a pretty tasty combo for those of us who like to shoot but sometimes miss things.

dimwishlist:item=66875353&perks=1561002382,2450788523,1890422124#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Avalanche may look like a slightly misshapen potato, but as machine guns go, this thing will do work. Killing Wind will push your range out and give you the zoomies, tap the trigger keeps you honest with your recoil, and High-Cal rounds will flinch off even the most persistent of snipers. Scopes on this thing really come down to personal preference, so use whichever one you like best. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Great damage, great ammo reserves and more super energy than you can shake a stick at (or whatever the phrase is). Give this thing a try, and become the Weeb you were meant to be!

dimwishlist:item=407621213&perks=3301904089,2869569095,3300816228,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Berenger's sits in an odd place, in that it's a rapid fire frame, so your mileage with it may vary. Spike/Auto-Loading/Field Prep, however, is a snappy PvE roll that'll work in almost any situation, with the extra reserves and fast reload on demand from Field Prep being particularly welcome. The barrel perk doesn't really make much of a difference, but try to maximise handling and blast radius. [Recommended MW: Blast Radius]

dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=3250034553,1561002382,2846385770#notes:The Warmind: Omnivore pick. Albeit not a range min/maxed variant of this weapon, this is optimised for accuracy at extreme range for an SMG, able to touch up to 21m before damage drop off, and inflicting significant flinch in PvP, and easily staggering combatants in PvE.

As long as you can make sure you're not missing (as this weapon lacks tracking), this offers some of the best sustained DPS of any heavy weapon.

Extended mag means you can have up to 146 bullets in a magazine, which is, y'know, insane.

Relentless + Whirlwind is an extremely reliable combination, and technical outperforms Vorpal weapon in the DPS stakes, albeit you have to consume 4 ammo to ramp it up to maximum. Jagged Edge keeps your damage output up, so swing away.
dimwishlist:item=2782325302&perks=3666208348,2590710093,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvE DPS monstrosity. Vorpal is hands down the best perk in column 4 of this weapon, so congrats on that. Tireless Blade gives you back ammo when you murder something with your super slam, which feels great and keeps you Titaning hard and Titaning fast. Jagged Edge is the icing on the cake on the very long and sharp cake.

dimwishlist:item=2742838701&perks=1968497646,3400784728,1774574192,#notes:Rostopher: Oddball PvE pick. This roll will work well in situations where you maybe need an extra shield-cracking weapon. Armor-Piercing Rounds enhances its damage on shields, and Osmosis will let you turn it elemental with the throw of a grenade. The site doesn't really matter, but try to pick something that enhances stability or handling. [Recommended MW: Reload]
dimwishlist:item=2742838701&perks=1561002382,47981717,2846385770#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. For a ludicrously consistent neutral hand cannon, look no further. This thing can touch up to nearly 33 meters, has incredibly forgiving aim assistance, and opening shot will magnetise that first shot to your opponents head. An outstanding duelling weapon, definitely worth a keep if you're into PvP. Choose a sight that gives you buffs to either Range or Stability. [Recommended MW: Range]

Tac Mag is the go-to pick for almost any weapon in PvE if it's available, providing flat buffs to mag size, stability and reload speed. Pick the scope that provides the best bonuses.

Armor-Piercing ensures it's doing maximum damage to shields and barriers (and collateral kills are extremely fun to pull off), Overflow means you can get an enormous 32-round magazine, and Disruption Break renders targets vulnerable to kinetic damage, which benefits both you and your team. A great nightfall weapon. Pick the scope you hate the least! [Recommended MW: Handling]

Tac Mag is the PvE GOAT of magazine perks, buffing your stability, magazine size and reload speed. Just pick any barrel you have that fits you preference, and you have a perfect all-rounder PvE SMG.

Tac Mag is a great addition to the weapon, bumping up your mag size, reload speed and stability. Pick pretty much any barrel perk that you have that suits you.

This is an OG 'god roll' that, in truth, only really functions against bosses with either very large or very stationary crit spots. But if you can land every crit, you can fire up to 11 rounds before needed to reload, and the final 5 that you fire will cycle the high-impact reserves buff, giving you a surprisingly impressive damage output for a single mag. This could have a better magazine (namely Tactical Mag), but Appended Mag will do the job. [Recommended MW: Reload or Stability]

Legal Action II is a low-key contender for one of the best pulses in the game, thanks to its rock solid base stats, and meaty 22 zoom, giving it a base range of just under 45m, which is a lot. The only reason this isn't better than the messenger is Desperado, that's it. Arrowhead Brake entirely straightens up the recoil and Accurized pushes your accuracy cone out even further. Heating Up makes the weapon handle better as you secure kills, making it easier to secure the two-burst kills.

Whilst pellet shotguns largely pale in comparison to slugs for PvE, this combination of perks 3 and 4 is unique, and has good utility, particularly in activities where you have a lot of arc shields to crack, so it can be used almost in the same manner as a blinding GL.

This is not a sword that you take into high-difficulty content, and given that fact, this roll is absolutely terrific for lower-end PvE. Run at the nearest cloud of hurt, and go ham. You're almost guaranteed to hit three enemies, which'll proc the 35% damage bonus from One for All, and then you're REALLY cooking. Tireless blade will return ammo if you secure kills with your heavy attack, and given its wide area of effect, you can murder entire groups of enemies with a single stroke. Enduring ramps your ammo count all the way to maximum, and you can increase it even further with backup mag.

There's no particularly terrific perks in column 3 for these purposes, so make sure to read the description of the unmarked perk and make use of it as best you can. Demolitionist is particularly good on special weapons, due to the increased recharge on your grenade (20%, compared to Primary and Heavy's 10%), allowing you to recharge your grenade with just 5 secured kills, or less, depending on your Discipline.

Fluted bumps up your intrinsically low handling to acceptable levels, as well as giving a slight stabilty bump. Tac Mag is the GOAT mag perk for PvE, giving you a magazine size, stabilty and reload speed bump, so your weapon handles well, has great stability and insane range thanks to its base 26 zoom.

Anyway, the point is, this is a solid roll of this weapon - secure at least one kill with it, to reload for 2 rockets in the pipe, with Cluster Bomb and Black Powder maximising its area of effect.

Whilst Rapid-Fires are generally not as good as their more impactful counterparts, this one has decent forgiveness for those who are accuracy deficient. Thing to bear in mind is that it will almost certainly take 2 grenades to kill the first person, but with Rampage procced, you are guaranteed to kill a second if you manage to find them. There's only one perk that's particularly useful in PvP for this weapon, and you don't have it, but you can make do with whatever you got here. [Recommended MW: Handling or Velocity]

Whirlwind and Relentless synergise brilliantly, with Relentless returning you ammo as you ramp up Whirlwind with light attacks, to unleash a massively damaging heavy attack at something off in the distance. Swordmaster's makes your heavy attack/guard energy recharge faster, and go for whatever blade trait you have the increases your damage the most.

In harder content, it becomes increasingly difficult to land successive strikes on targets, making the usual god roll on swords of Relentless/Whirlwind less and less useful. So this here is an excellent alternative to that. Vorpal gives you a nice flat 15% damage buff to yellow-bar targets, Tireless blade will return ammo to you if you secure a kill, with Swordmaster's maximising your heavy attack's uptime. Pick the blade that gives you the most additional impact.

Whilst better specific pairings of perks are available, if you don't have another one with Subsistence, this is worth keeping purely on the strength of this perk, and then you also have Trench Barrel, which whilst not quite as strong as it was in D2Y1, is still a decent perk for ramping up your shotgun's damage, especially in lower-end content.

Auto-Loading will keep the magazine loaded when you stow it, ready to go for the next target. Assault Mag helps you get your 3 super-charged shots out fast.

// A Swift Verdict
dimwishlist:item=1626503676&perks=4267945040,1683379515#notes:The Warmind: High-end PvE pick. When Sidearms are in the champion meta, this will do at least some work in higher-end PvE activities. Full Auto lets you hold down the trigger to get the maximum fire rate, and Disruption Break weakens shielded targets when you crack their shields, letting you unleash with a high damage kinetic weapon.

Whilst sidearms will never fully control the PvP meta, they will always remain an effective pairing with a longer range weapon in lieu of a shotgun or fusion rifle. This one in particular is a very rangey boy, able to do full damage up to nearly 18m, which will help you shut down those pesky shotgun rushers faster, and Full Auto bypasses the one downside of this archetype by allowing you to simply hold down the trigger to fire as fast as possible.

dimwishlist:item=4095896073&perks=201365942,3365897133#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. A great bow, with a great roll, especially when Bows are in the champ meta. Explosive gives you a ~12% damage boost, and Archer's Tempo lets you fire faster every time you land a crit. Look for string and arrow perks that enhance your draw time or stability. [Recommended MW: Stability or Draw Time]
dimwishlist:item=4095896073&perks=201365942,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: The classic bow roll. If you like bows, this'll do it for you - it's a beautiful-feeling bow that is rare as hell, so if you have this, keep it. Pretty much any string and arrow perks will work. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

dimwishlist:item=6857689&perks=2866798147,47981717#notes:The Warmind: PvP dueling pick. 140s will always be in vogue in PvP, given their high burst damage capability.  No Distractions lets you cover angles effectively, reducing the flinch you take from folk sliding round corners and getting the first tag on you.

dimwishlist:item=6857689&perks=3400784728,1954620775#notes:The Warmind: High-end PvE pick. Timed Payload is relatively rare compared to its more instantly gratifying Explosive cousin, and hey look! You got one! Giving you a roughly 12% damage boost in PvE, this is invaluable in higher end content, particularly when hand cannons are in the champion meta; with Triple Tap refunding you ammo for securing succesive precision shots. Look for Tactical Mag if you have it in column 2, otherwise try to enhance your reload speed or magazine size as best you can. More or less any of the sights in column 1 will do for these purposes, so pick that one that makes the weapon feel best for you. [Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed]
dimwishlist:item=6857689&perks=2946784966,2458213969#notes:The Warmind: Omnivore pick. Multi-Kill Clip and Tunnel Vision synergise extremely well, and whilst the reload speed on this weapon will be somewhat lacking compared to Outlaw, what you lose in snappy reload, you gain in ability to consistently land high-damage shots, so this is particularly good for controller players. Look to bump up your stability, range and reload speed with your barrel and sight perks. [Recommended MW: Stability, Range or Reload]

dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=3523296417,11612903#notes:The Warmind: These two perks in combination on any weapon are at the very least interesting, if not outright great. Fire your weapon, throw a grenade to reload it and if you secure a kill with that grenade, you get a 33% damage boost. Use that damage boost to secure more kills, which charges up your grenade faster, meaning you can repeat the cycle. There may be better specific rolls available of this particular weapon, but as a starter for 10, this is great.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=1820235745,4049631843#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Subsistence in combination with a damage perk is almost universally excellent on all weapons - as the damage perk ramps up your damage, you take less bullets to kill a target, which means the returned bullets to your magazine from Subsistence have more impact. Look to increase your magazine size further with your magazine perk, and more or less any of your column 1 perks will be just fine.

dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=280464955,47981717#notes:The Warmind: PvP pick. Whilst there are much better rapid fire snipers available for PvE, this does have this relatively unique combo that can have you landing surprise headshots, even from hip fire, as long as you remember to crouch before you fire. Look to extend your range (for aim assist purposes) with your barrel and magazine perks. [Recommended MW: Range or Handling]
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=1556840489,3038247973#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. If you really need another rapid fire sniper, you can do much worse than this one. Explosive gives it a ~12% damage boost, and Lead from Gold ensures your ammo is topped up no matter what kind of brick drops. Look to extended your magazine size in Column 2, and your stability or handling with Column 1. [Recommended MW: Handling or Stability]
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=2866798147,47981717,#notes:Rostopher: If you're mad enough to want to use this weapon in PvP, this is probably the best 3rd and 4th perk combo for it. Bear in mind that you'll need, count 'em, THREE body shots to kill a guardian if you miss the headshot, so make sure you're landing those headshots, and with this roll, it's just a little bit more forgiving to do so.

// Arc Logic
dimwishlist:item=2723909519&perks=1570042021,3592538738#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 600s still do work in PvP, and Arc Logic is a fairly typical 600. Being arc is great against pesky Heir Apparent users too. Heating Up makes you more and more accurate as you rack up the kills. Normally I'd recommend a damage perk, but both those available on this weapon are difficult to proc in PvP, so Wellspring naturally steps up to the plate, being extremely solid for your neutral game. Pick barrel and mag perks that enhance your stability, recoil direction and range. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=2723909519&perks=2450788523,4104185692#notes:Rostopher: PvE Pick. Arc Logic is back, and whilst in principle it's just an arc Gnawing Hunger, it's recoil tends a little more strongly to the left, so may feel a bit odd in comparison. Thus, try to pick mag perks that straighten up your recoil, or alternatively ones that buff stability. Perk-wise, Frenzy being a reload and damage perk in one opens up your column 3 for a utility pick, and Killing Wind is absolutely the best of those available for PvE. [Recommended MW: Reload]

dimwishlist:item=1967303408&perks=3513791699,3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: Whilst overall, this weapon is a bit disappointing, it is one of only a handful of weapons that can roll mulligan, and combining this with Rampage does turn it into a bit of a 'hold down the trigger and hope I kill everything in front of me' weapon, which makes it somewhat fun in low-level content.

// Arctic Haze
dimwishlist:item=20935540&perks=1820235745,2848615171,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Arctic Haze is sorely underrated, and that's largely down to it's lack of damage-boosting perk.

Whilst you're not getting full utility out of Killing Wind, giving bows have extremely high range already - but the zoomies and the bonus to handling upon securing a kill are very useful for putting distance between you and the enemy.

This is offset by rather low handling, however as long as you remember to crouch (and remember, sliding counts as 'Crouching'), you can offset this deficit significantly. Opening Shot is the only perk on slug shotguns that can actually push its range past the cap, so is super valuable for landing a crit further out.

dimwishlist:item=577528837&perks=280464955,2726471870#notes:The Warmind: PvP dueling pick. Rapid Fire scouts are an underrated pick for PvP, particularly at extended ranges, due to being able to flinch the heck out of your target as you burn them down. With this roll, remember to crouch when you start firing for a huge stability and recoil direction bump, making it easy to land your shots consistent.

A classic combo for a classic gun - both of your perks here reward securing crits, and Headstone in particular is fantastic when paired with a Stasis subclass.

dimwishlist:item=235827225&perks=2846385770,588594999#notes:The Warmind: PvP pick. Do you like having 100 aim assist on your hand cannons? Well then, look no further. All you need to get this up to 100 aim assist is to whack on either a Targetting Adjuster on the weapon itself, or Hand Cannon Targetting on your helmet. The latter frees up your weapon for something like Icarus Grip, Quick Access Sling or Freehand Grip. For your barrel and magazine perks, you can go one of two ways. For consistency, lean into Stability, trying to get it above 75, which turns it into an unflinching laser beam. Alternatively, spec entirely into Range for a 140 that can hit for full damage at up to 35 metres, 6 metres more than the majority of others. [Recommended MW: Stability or Range]

// Legal Action II
dimwishlist:item=3409645497&perks=1570042021,4104185692#notes:The Warmind: Legal Action II is a low-key contender for one of the best pulses in the game, thanks to its rock solid base stats, and meaty 22 zoom, giving it a base range of just under 45m, which is a lot. Frenzy is a terrific perk on almost everything, giving you a nice buff to damage and reload speed when it's active. Heating Up makes the weapon handle incrementally better as you secure kills. Look for magazine perks that enhance your stability (you don't really need more range), reload speed or magazine size, and use Arrowhead Brake if you have it, otherwise go for stability and handling from your barrel perk.

// Long Shadow
dimwishlist:item=3745990145&perks=2869569095,3038247973#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Long Shadow is a terrific DPS sniper with the right roll, and this here is certainly the foundation of it. Field Prep gives you extra rounds in reserves, and a super faset reload as long as you remember to crouch. As the weapon lacks Vorpal Weapon, Explosive Payload is the next best thing, giving you a roughly 12% damage bump compared to Vorpal's 15%. Pick any magazine perk that increases magazine size, and more or less any scope will work great here. [Recommended MW: Handling]

Successive crits bump up your stability, making landing the next shot easier, as well as increase your reload speed, AND load extra rounds into your mag from reserves. With Extended Mag, you can fire up to seven times before reloading, so put that on if you've got it. Otherwise, try to increase your mag size as far as possible, and pretty much any scope will be fine with this roll. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=3745990145&perks=957782887,588594999#notes:The Warmind: PvP pick. Snapshot Sights and Moving Target is almost an inevitability for PvP on this weapon.

Whilst Love and Death is a shadow of its former self after its reissue, there are still some vaguely solid rolls up for grabs, and this here is one of them. Auto-Loading lets you fire it, then stow it to let it reload, and Chain Reaction is good fun, particularly in lower end content where you're more likely to secure the initial kill.

// Main Ingredient
dimwishlist:item=253196586&perks=3300816228,3425386926#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Whilst not quite as potent as the PLUG ONE, this weapon can still do some work in PvE, and you have here an entirely serviceable roll of it. Auto-Loading lets you stow it to reload, and Rampage amps up your damage as you secure kills. You should have one of the Red Dot scopes, given that this thing rolls three and there are only four possible, so pick that one; and pretty much any battery perk will be just fine. [Recommended MW: Stability or Range]
dimwishlist:item=253196586&perks=2405638014,2846385770#notes:The Warmind: PvP pick. Rangefinder and Red Dot Micro will do a significant amount of work at securing you kills at a distance. There's pretty much no bad picks in Column 3 for PvP, so make sure to read the description of the perk that you got, and make use of it as best you can. For battery perks, go for Liquid Coils, Projection Fuse or Particle Repeater (in that order of priority).

Whilst not quite as potent as the PLUG ONE, this weapon can still do some work in PvE, and you have here an entirely serviceable roll of it. Threat Detector gives you a bonus to handling, stability and reload speed when near one or more enemies, which plays well with the ranges that you'll be operating at, and allows you to quickly proc Kill Clip should you need to. You should have on of either Red Dot Micro or Red Dot 2 MOA in your scope column - use one of those, and pretty much any battery perk will do just fine here. [Recommended MW: Stability or Range]

If you like melee-focused builds, whilst there are better One-Two Punch shotguns available (ideally you want a Lightweight shotgun for their snappy handling), this one will do you if you don't have a better one. Threat Detector will also make it handle snappily with enemies nearby, which, given that you will be punching them, they absolutely will be. For your barrel and magazine perks, if you have Full Choke, use that, otherwise try to enhance your handling and reload speed as best you can. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Memory Interdict
dimwishlist:item=3165547384&perks=3300816228,2396489472#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Memory Interdict is an extremely solid heavy GL, and you have here a very solid foundational roll for goofing around in low-end content. Auto-Loading lets you stow the weapon to allow it to reload, and securing a kill will make them explode, which will get you more kills.

Model 8 Red, combined with Kill Clip is outrageously potent in Crucible on this weapon, with the +4 zoom from the scope pushing this thing's range way further than an SMG has any right to compete at, and Kill Clip dropping your optimal TTK to an eye-watering 0.47 seconds if you land all crits.

dimwishlist:item=1835747805&perks=1820235745,2848615171#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Whilst 180 handcannons don't fare particularly well without Explosive or Timed Payload, this here is still a decently acceptable roll for running about in low-end content, as Dragonfly collateral kills will proc Subsistence, and it has a meaty enough mag that you're getting 2 bullets back per kill, meaning you may never need to actually reload it. Bear in mind, however, that this reloads like a dead goat, so try to maximise your reload speed with your magazine perk, and more or less any sight will do fine here.

// Negative Space
dimwishlist:item=3629968765&perks=1749209109,3913600130#notes:The Warmind: A very basic bitch roll, but entirely usable nonetheless. You don't have THE 4/4 god roll, but as a starter for 10, this'll do some work. Relentless gives you back ammo for landing light attacks, and Whirlwind ramps up your damage as you do so, allowing to unleash a massively damaging heavy attack at x5 stacks. Look for Swordmaster's Guard and Jagged Edge for the 4/4, but otherwise just run whatever you have here.
dimwishlist:item=3629968765&perks=1683379515#notes:The Warmind: You have here perhaps the one perk that actually sets this sword apart from the rest of them. Disruption Break is super rare on swords, and can be used in combination with a high damage kinetic weapon (think Sniper Rifles or spec GLs) to absolutely vaporise shielded combatants. Whilst you don't have the 4/4 god roll for this, this'll be interesting to hold on to until you do. Use Jagged Edge and Swordmaster's if you have them, otherwise more or less anything in columns 1 and 2 will be fine, and be sure to read the description of your perk in column 3, and try to make use of it as best you can.

One for All is actually surprisingly good on swords in general, giving a 35% damage buff, and given the purposes that you'll be using this for, combining it with Enduring Blade means you'll have a lot of ammo available to proc it, eliminating the need for Jagged Edge.

Whilst significantly better PvE snipers are available, if you are in dire need of an arc sniper for PvE content, you can do far worse than this thing, which will hit like a train, particularly on yellow-bar combatants and bosses.

However, for those of us who are terrible snipers, remember that the higher the zoom, the higher the aim assist. Mulligan turns this into a budget Revoker, giving a chance (rather than a guarantee) of a refunded bullet if you miss, and Opening Shot helps you land it. You'll need to run something on your armour that enhances your handling (Sniper Dexterity mods, or Ophidian Aspect on warlocks), to make it truly usable, but still, as a novelty this is pretty good.

Whilst 140 snipers have somewhat fallen out of favour, given that they require 3 body shots to kill a target, making them deeply unforgiving weapons if you fail to land the headshot. That said, if you are a confident sniper, this roll is capable of doing some work. Moving Target and Opening Shot together effectively max out your aim assist value on the first shot of your attack, freeing up your mod slot for something like Icarus Grip or Sprint Grip. Go for magazine and barrel perks that enhance handling first, then range as best you can. [Recommended MW: Handling, Handling or Handling]

Whilst Frenzy is awkward at best on Snipers, it's 12% damage buff is not to be sniffed at, given that it's effectively the same damage bump as Vorpal Weapon. As such, this weapon can prove valuable in situations where you've got a significant amount of time to deal boss damage - fire another weapon for 12 seconds, then pull this guy out with Frenzy procced for a significant chunk of burst DPS. The perks in column 3 don't really matter for these purposes, so be sure to read the description of whatever you have and try to make use of it.

Rewind Rounds effectively functions as a more forgiving Triple Tap, allowing you land body shots but still see a return, which can prove invaluable for targets that wiggle around. High-Impact Reserves will give you bonus damage on those returned rounds too, mean the weapon's damage ramps up fairly signficantly the more shots you land.

And in column 4, you've got options here. For optimal burst DPS, combine Rewind with Frenzy, for a chunky 15% damage boost to however many shots you're able to get off without reloading. For more general usage, pair it with Firefly, as any enemies tagged by the Firefly explosion count as 'hits' for the purposes of Rewind Rounds. For your magazine perk, look to extend your magazine size to get the most out of it, ideally with Tac Mag, but Extended Mag will do fine as well; and for barrels, look to bump up your handling or stability to keep your shots on target.

Uniquely among Linear Fusion Rifles, Reed's can roll Triple Tap, which conjures ammunition out of thin air for sustained DPS, and Vorpal gives you that beautiful 15% damage buff. Bosses with easy-to-tag crit spots stand very little chance against this weapon. If you have Ionized Battery, that'll let you squeeze out an extra 2 shots from your DPS cycle - otherwise, pretty much any battery perk will be fine, and for barrels, pick something that doesn't hurt your handling, but otherwise whatever. [Recommended MW: Handling, Stability or Reload]
dimwishlist:item=2475355656&perks=2284787283,1771339417#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Whilst not as consistent as Triple Tap given its RNG nature, Clown Cartridge is still pretty decent on this weapon, allowing you to fire between 1 and 4 additional shots on top of the base magazine, battery perk pending. iring Line gives you that beautiful 20% damage buff as long as you are standing near a teammate (do note, bugged at time of writing, Nov 2021, it's only 14% but should be fixed soon?). If you have Ionized Battery, that'll let you squeeze out an extra 2 shots from your DPS cycle - otherwise, pretty much any battery perk will be fine, and for barrels, pick something that doesn't hurt your handling, but otherwise whatever.

Lead from Gold is great for ensuring your weapon always has ammo regardless of what colour brick has dropped, and being able to get chunks of grenade energy back per kill, as well as reload your weapon by throwing your grenade, is super valuable here. Magazine-wise, if you have Assault Mag, go for that, otherwise anything that enhances reload speed or magazine size is just fine; for barrels, focus on handling or range. [Recommended MW: Handling]

dimwishlist:item=548958835&perks=3096702027,1683379515#notes:The Warmind: High end PvE pick. If/when trace rifles enter the champion meta, this roll will be immensely useful, particular if trace rifles become anti-barrier, and if there are solar shields in the activity you're doing. Genesis will refill the magazine if you break a shield or anti-barrier champ, and Distruption Break will weaken them to you and your teammate's kinetic weapons. For barrels and batteries, look to enhance your stability or reload speed where possible, and failing that, go for magazine size and handling. [Recommended MW: Stability or Reload]
dimwishlist:item=548958835&perks=1820235745,4104185692#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. A more basic roll of this weapon, but a functional one, Frenzy gives you a nice 15% damage bonus as well as snappy handling and reload, and that feeds into making Subsistence more efficient.

dimwishlist:item=548958835&perks=1820235745,2610012052#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. This weapon is where Golden Tricorn really comes into its own albeit it more or less locking this weapon for use with a Solar subclass. Get a kill, then get a powered melee or grenade kill, and enjoy the massive 50% damage bonus this grants you. Subsistence combined with this damage boost will see you rarely needing to reload too. For barrels and batteries, look to enhance your stability or reload speed where possible, and failing that, go for magazine size and handling. [Recommended MW: Stability or Reload]

// Sacred Provenance
dimwishlist:item=2408405461&perks=2846385770,1015611457#notes:The Warmind: Omnivore pick. The last of its kind, this weapon still has excellent utility in both PvE and PvP. Kill Clip gives you a big damage boost, and injects forgiveness into your PvP TTK, and Rangefinder pushes out its already not insubstantial range. Combine with range enhancing barrel and magazine perks, and you've got an excelent little pulse on your hands here. [Recommended MW: Handling or Reload]

// Scathelocke
dimwishlist:item=602618796&perks=1570042021,3425386926#notes:The Warmind: 6v6 PvP pick. Scathelocke functions better than most other 600rpm ARs thanks to its base 20 zoom lending it more range. Heating Up and Rampage pair very well together, making your weapon do more damage and become more accurate as you secure kills, allowing you to go on something of a rip. Look for barrel and magazine perks that enhance your range and stability. Side note, this is an entirely acceptable roll in PvE, should you wish to use it there. [Recommended MW: Range or Stability]
dimwishlist:item=602618796&perks=1820235745,3425386926#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Scathelocke is an excellent all-rounder AR, thanks to its high base zoom, which allows you to touch ranges far greater than most other ARs. Subsistence paired with Rampage is always an great pick, especially on weapons with high magazine sizes - each kill ramps up your damage, and returns ammo to your magazine, so you have more bullets but need less to secure kills. Pretty much any barrel and magazine perks will work with this, so choose whichever ones feel most agreeable to you. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=602618796&perks=3436462433,699525795#notes:The Warmind: 3v3 PvP pick. Scathelocke functions better than most other 600rpm ARs thanks to its base 20 zoom lending it more range, and making it excellent for when you inevitably start duelling hand cannons. Surplus gives you an escalating bump to stability (and handling and reload, though they're less important here) the more abilities you have charged, and Eye of the Storm keeps you on target as you take damage in a duel. Look for barrel and magazine perks that enhance your range and stability. [Recommended MW: Range or Stability]

Tunnel Vision and Multikill Clip synergise rather well, particularly in situations where you have the opportunity to chain kills, allowing you to go on something of a rip.

This thing functions at the same ranges that Gnawing Hunger can, and arguably has better PvP specific rolls, one of which you have here. Whilst Dynamic Sway Reduction isn't quite as impactful as Killing Wind on the weapon's effectiveness, it can be a great boon to those who struggle to control automatic weapons' recoil, keeping the thing stable and allowing you land more shots; and Kill Clip brings your PvP TTK down to a blistering 0.6 seconds.

With Eager Edge, it becomes an outstandingly fun and unique weapon, serving as both a movement tool and a method of murder. And hey look! You got it! You also got Swordmaster's Guard, the best guard, given that it's the only one that speeds up the charge rate of your heavy attack. You don't have Enduring Blade (which maximises your ammo capacity), so pick the one that increases it the most, and as a starter for 10 (and given how rare this is), you can do worse than keeping this one.

Moving Target makes it just a little easier to land crits, and the bonus movement speed whilst ADS is useful too. One stack of Rampage shaves off a single bullet from your optimal kill profile, which effectively makes the weapon more forgiving should you miss a round from a burst. Go for the scope you hate the least, and pick the magazine perk that enhances stability or range best. [Recommended MW: Stability or Range]
dimwishlist:item=3593598010&perks=,1820235745,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Rapid-fire pulses are somewhat underrated in PvE, particular in low- and mid-tier content, and what you have here is an excellent one. Subsistence and Rampage is a beautiful synergistic combo, meaning you need less and less shots to secure a kill, which in turn makes the returned ammo from Subsistence go even further. Go for the scope you hate the least, and pick the magazine perk that enhances stability or reload speed best. [Recommended MW: Reload or Stability]

Killing Wind will push that range out even further, and Kill Clip pushes your PvP TTK down to a ludicrous 0.43 seconds, and ramping up your damage in PvE. Even without min/maxing the barrel and sights, this will be a monster. [Recommended MW: Any]

dimwishlist:item=3799980700&perks=3425386926,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: Whilst 150 RPM Scouts are a bit of an odd pick for both PvE and PvP, this roll is unique in that it is one of only two weapons in the game where it's possible to roll both Rampage and Kill Clip at the same time, giving you two different ways to ramp up your damage, and stacking on top of one another should you secure kills quickly enough. Slap on a Rampage Spec and go have some fun with this.

Rampage ramps up your damage nicely, and synergises well with Ambitious Assassin, allowing you to secure more kills to get the most out of the perk.

// Widow's Bite
dimwishlist:item=1271343896&perks=,1556840489,3523296417#notes:Rostopher: Whilst this weapon is not as good as the statistically and functionally superior Ikelos Sniper, you do have here one of a couple of interesting rolls on the weapon, so if you like the aesthetic and have space, hold onto it. Lead from Gold will ensure a more steady flow of ammo, and Demolitionist both recharges your grenade on kill, and allows you to reload the weapon by throwing said grenade. Pick barrel and magazine perks that enhance stability and magazine size. [Recommended MW: Reload or Handling]

// Wishbringer
dimwishlist:item=3356526253&perks=1047830412957782887#notes:The Warmind:  [Recommended MW: Range]

dimwishlist:item=3356526253&perks=3161816588,47981717#notes:The Warmind:  [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3356526253&perks=,3161816588,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. For lower end content, if you enjoy zipping about murdering redbars with your special ammo, this is a great little roll to hold on to, letting you scythe through waves of adds, and as long as you remember to slide, you may never need to reload it. Go for barrel perks that enhance handling or range (avoiding full choke), and magazine perks that either bump up your magazine size, or do the same as the barrel perks. [Recommended MW: Handling or Range]

// Wolftone Draw
dimwishlist:item=3472875143&perks=201365942,2848615171#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Explosions on crit kills, combined with faster draw time from crits, this is a super solid mid-to-low tier content ad clear weapon. Almost but not quite a legendary Trinity Ghoul. [Recommended MW: Draw Time or Reload]
dimwishlist:item=3472875143&perks=201365942,4104185692#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Frenzy is a 'good on everything' perk, and bows are no exception. Faster reload when it procs, combined with faster draw time from crits, you'll be firing a flurry of super-charged arrows with this. [Recommended MW: Draw Time or Reload]

// Xenoclast IV
dimwishlist:item=2891672170&perks=1631667848,2679249093#notes:Rostopher: PvE buildcrafter pick. This weapon will pair great with any builds that you have that involve punching things - top-tree arc hunter, middle-tree solar titan, for example. Ramp up your melee damage, get a kill, reload your shotgun, go on about your day.
dimwishlist:item=2891672170&perks=791862061,3300816228#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst pellet shotguns have fallen out of the PvE meta, Auto-Loading and Assault mag is a great base to build from on this weapon. There are a TON of great choices in column 4, so have a read of the description of the perk you did get, and see if you can make use of it. Pick any barrel perk except full choke, which will reduce your potential precision damage. [Recommended MW: Range or Handling]

// Zealot's Reward
dimwishlist:item=2209003210&perks=,3300816228,1683379515#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. For mid-tier content, where you might need a slightly more specialised roll, this'll be pretty good - though other Distruption Break options are available. Auto-Loading lets you stow it to reload whilst you do work with another weapon. Go for Liquid Coils if you have, otherwise go for enhancements to your magazine size or stability in the battery column, and go with a barrel perk that enhances either range or stability. [Recommended MW: Anything except Charge Time]
dimwishlist:item=2209003210&perks=,3300816228,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. For lower-tier content, Rapid Fire frames are excellent for general add clear, and this is a great roll for those purposes. Rampage ramps up your damage with each kill, with x3 allowing to one-shot a variety of different orange bar opponents, and Auto-Loading lets you stow it to reload whilst you do work with another weapon. Go for Liquid Coils if you have, otherwise go for enhancements to your magazine size or stability in the battery column, and go with a barrel perk that enhances either range or stability. [Recommended MW: Anything except Charge Time]

// Zephyr
dimwishlist:item=3400256755&perks=3650930298,3705817207#notes:The Warmind: Without Cold Steel, Zephyr is just another adaptive sword and pales in comparison to the potential of others. However, with Cold Steel, it becomes immediately interesting, given that it’s a method of applying stacks of Slow, and even freezing targets, without having to use your abilities. Thus, this weapon has value straight out the gate, and whilst your guard and blade leave something to be desired, Duelist's Trance is actually valuable here, as it speeds up the charging of your heavy attack so you can afflict your target with Stasis once again, so it's a decent one to keep, especially given how hard to acquire this sword is.
dimwishlist:item=3400256755&perks=3650930298,1749209109#notes:The Warmind: Without Cold Steel, Zephyr is just another adaptive sword and pales in comparison to the potential of others. However, with Cold Steel, it becomes immediately interesting, given that it’s a method of applying stacks of Slow, and even freezing targets, without having to use your abilities. Thus, this weapon has value straight out the gate, and whilst your guard and blade leave something to be desired, Relentless Strikes is a great all-rounder perk for Swords, so it's a decent one to keep, especially given how hard to acquire this sword is.

However, with Cold Steel, it becomes immediately interesting, given that it’s a method of applying stacks of Slow, and even freezing targets, without having to use your abilities. Thus, this weapon has value straight out the gate, and whilst your guard and blade leave something to be desired, Tireless Blade synergises well with Cold Steel, so it's a decent one to keep, especially given how hard to acquire this sword is.

// Annual Skate
dimwishlist:item=6857689&perks=1954620775#notes:The Warmind: Omnivore pick. Timed Payload is relatively rare compared to its more instantly gratifying Explosive cousin, and hey look! You got one! Giving you an effective damage bonus in PvE, and increasing the weapon's flinching ability in PvP, this'll be an excellent roll to try in both. All of the perks in column 3 on this weapon have some utility in combination with this, so have a read of what you got and make use of it as best you can. For magazine perks, look for range if you plan on using it in PvP, and magazine size and reload speed for PvE. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Any
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=1820235745,11612903#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Subsistence in combination with a damage perk is almost universally excellent on all weapons - as the damage perk ramps up your damage, you take less bullets to kill a target, which means the returned bullets to your magazine from Subsistence have more impact. Plus, with this one, you can proc it by securing a grenade kill, going instantly to a 33% damage boost to get the maximum damage out of your magazine. Look to increase your magazine size further with your magazine perk, and more or less any of your barrel perks will be just fine. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Archon's Thunder
dimwishlist:item=1967303408&perks=3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: Rampage is literally the only useful perk on column 4 of this weapon, and since you have it, this is probably worth keeping despite its other perks. Try to get stability, magazine size and reload speed from the magazine and barrel perks.

// Ascendancy
dimwishlist:item=725408022&perks=#notes:Banshee-44: Hrrrm… proud of this one. Reckon you'll want Impulse Amplifier and Explosive Light for the most part, but Ambitious and Chain Reaction ain't half bad for clearing out those clouds of thrall you're so fond of running into. Either way, it'll make explosions, so choice is yours, Guardian.

// Bequest
dimwishlist:item=3366545721&perks=2726471870,#notes:Rostopher: PvE oddball pick. Thresh is good on swords, and this is one of only a handful that can roll it. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Biting Winds
dimwishlist:item=1621657423&perks=3365897133#notes:The Warmind: High-end PvE pick. Explosive Head is a de-facto flat bonus to your damage in PvE, giving you a roughly 12% bump, which is not to be sniffed out. For column 3, there's no bad pick to pair with this perk, so make sure to read the description of the perk you got, and try to make use of it. More or less any string and arrow perk will be fine here, so go for whatever makes your stats the most agreeable. [Recommended MW: Accuracy or Handling]
dimwishlist:item=1621657423&perks=3350417888#notes:The Warmind: High-end PvE pick. Sympathetic Arsenal is particularly good on bows, given that you are 'reloading' every time you nock an arrow, so this can be very useful for situations where you need to absolutely make sure your weapons are loaded. For column 3, there's no bad pick to pair with this perk, so make sure to read the description of the perk you got, and try to make use of it. More or less any string and arrow perk will be fine here, so go for whatever makes your stats the most agreeable. [Recommended MW: Accuracy or Handling]

// Blast Battue
dimwishlist:item=2453357042&perks=2396489472,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Chain reaction on this weapon is possibly the only thing that makes it stand out. Otherwise, the odd placement of perks in the columns make it tough to love this weapon in PvE when Interference VI exists. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Borrowed Time
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=4104185692,#notes:Rostopher: Frenzy is terrific on SMGs, and given the wild perk pool on this weapon, even though the other perks aren't perfect, this might be worth keeping.
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=4049631843,#notes:Rostopher: One for All is terrific on SMGs, and given the wild perk pool on this weapon, even though the other perks aren't perfect, this might be worth keeping.
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=3643424744,#notes:Rostopher: Overflow will feel great on this weapon. The other perks may not be terrific combined with it, but given the wild selection of perks available on this weapon, it may be worth keeping purely on the strength of this perk.
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: Rampage is terrific on SMGs, and given the wild perk pool on this weapon, even though the other perks aren't perfect, this might be worth keeping.

// Bottom Dollar
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=3038247973,#notes:Rostopher: Given the absolutely wild perk pools on this weapon, the fact that you have one with Explosive Payload is pretty good - it's an excellent perk on hand cannons in both PvE and PvP. The other perks might not be great, but this perk carries the weapon a fair way on its own. Try to combo with barrel perks that enhance your stability and handling, and magazine perks that enhance your magazine size or range.
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: Given the absolutely wild perk pools on this weapon, the fact that you have one with Rampage is pretty good. The other perks might not be great, but this perk carries the weapon a fair way on its own. Try to combo with barrel perks that enhance your stability and handling, and magazine perks that enhance your magazine size or range.
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=2458213969#notes:Rostopher: Multi-Kill Clip is great on this weapon. Ideally you want something that enhances reload speed (Outlaw, Rapid Hit, Feeding Frenzy, Surplus). Avoid Subsistence, it feels awful. If you can get Tactical or Appended Magazine, that's great too. [Recommended MW: Any]

// BxR-55 Battler
dimwishlist:item=2708806099&perks=454085387#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Blunt Execution Rounds is unique to this weapon, and is at least interesting, if not an essential pick on it. Granting a 500% (!!!) damage increase to your next fired burst after you punch something, it can shred a surprising number of beefy enemies in low-to-mid tier content. In PvP, its not quite as heft, but still is enough to allow for a 2-burst kill instead of 3 after punching something. Also keep in mind that you can proc it even if it's stowed, so you can pull it out up to 10 seconds after punching something and still get the benefits of the perk. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=2708806099&perks=3523296417#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Demolitionist in Column 3 is always a good shout, as it replaces the likes of Outlaw as your reloader perk, as well as providing you with grenade charge upon securing kills. Have a check of your other primary trait and try to make use of it as best you can. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Code Duello
dimwishlist:item=2496242052&perks=3927722942#notes:Rostopher: PvE DPS pick. As long as you can make sure you're not missing (as this weapon lacks tracking), this offers some of the best sustained DPS of any heavy weapon. Particularly potent when combined with hot swapping, and even more so if someone is running Divinity.  Lasting Impression does a lot of work to make this weapon serviceable, so even without the perfect perks in the other slots, this will do work. [Recommended MW: Velocity]

// Cold Front
dimwishlist:item=1506719573&perks=4049631843#notes:Rostopher: Given the rarity of this weapon, if you managed to get one with One for All, consider yourself lucky. Pick barrel and mag perks that enhance either your magazine size, or stability and range.
dimwishlist:item=1506719573&perks=3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Given the rarity of this weapon, getting on with Rampage on it is a blessing in disguise. Hold on to it, and look for barrel and mag perks that enhance either your magazine size, or stability and range.

// Commemoration
dimwishlist:item=4230965989&perks=1523832109,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Reconstruction turns this weapon from 'another machine gun' into something special. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Coriolis Force
dimwishlist:item=3512349612&perks=4049631843#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Whilst this is an awkward weapon at best, it does have some unique things about it that make it vaguely usable. One for All is surprisingly easy to proc with Fusion Rifles, given that bolts invariably over-penetrate targets, so this perk can carry the weapon a fair way all by itself. Have a read of the description of the perk in column 3 and try to make use of it as best you can. For barrel and battery perks, use whatever makes your stats the most agreeable to you. [Recommended MW: Reload or Stability]

// Corrective Measure
dimwishlist:item=471518543&perks=2213355989,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Given that you are guaranteed to get less than half the magazine on heavy ammo pickup, you've got here a very dangerous weapon in PvP with just High Impact Reserves alone. Try to pick whatever barrel and mag perks you have that enhance stability or range, and make do with pretty much whatever you have in column 3.

// Corrective Measure (Timelost)
dimwishlist:item=3796510434&perks=3523296417#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Demolitionist is invariably strong when it appears in Column 3, and combining that with the guaranteed Firefly (given that any enemies that die to the Firefly explosion will proc Demolitionist) will give you big chunks of grenade energy back when you fire this into a crowd, and will let you reload but chucking your newly charged grenade. Look for barrels that increase the weapon's handling or stability, and mag perks that increase stability or range. [Recommended MW: Handling or Stability]
dimwishlist:item=3796510434&perks=2779035018#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Feeding Frenzy is a solid perk for LMGs, and combining that with the guaranteed Firefly, given that any enemies that die to the Firefly explosion will provide additional stacks of Feeding Frenzy, you're looking at regularly hitting the reload speed cap on the weapon so you can keep spitting bullets at everything. Look for barrels that increase the weapon's handling or stability, and mag perks that increase stability or range. [Recommended MW: Handling or Stability]
dimwishlist:item=3796510434&perks=3418782618#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Rewind Round is unique to VoG weapons, and combining that with the guaranteed Firefly (given that any enemies that get hit by the Firefly explosion will contribute to your 'hits' for the purposes of Rewind Rounds) will increase the number of rounds that get loaded into your magazine when you fire your last shot. Look for barrels that increase the weapon's handling or stability, and mag perks that increase stability or range. [Recommended MW: Handling or Stability]
dimwishlist:item=3796510434&perks=1820235745#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Subsistence is a solid perk for LMGs, and combining that with the guaranteed Firefly, given that any enemies that die to the Firefly explosion will proc Susbistence, this is an outstanding add-clear LMG. Look for barrels that increase the weapon's handling or stability, and mag perks that increase stability or range. [Recommended MW: Handling or Stability]

// Crimil's Dagger
dimwishlist:item=4292849692&perks=1015611457,#notes:Rostopher: Following the nerf to 120 precision damage, this is one of the only remaining 120s that can roll with Kill Clip, and can therefore still two-tap with its damage perk active. Whilst the weapon itself is not as good as other 120s - featuring poorer numbers on nearly every stat including magazine size - this does give it some merit.

// Crowd Pleaser
dimwishlist:item=3565520715&perks=2396489472,#notes:Rostopher: Given the absolutely wild perk pool of this weapon, getting Chain Reaction on this weapon is low-key cool, so you might want to hold onto this until you get a more specialised roll.

// Crown-Splitter
dimwishlist:item=2782325302&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: You did it! You got the best perk in column 4 on this weapon! The other perks might not be the best, but Vorpal makes this weapon absolutely slap without additional help.

// Dead Man's Tale
dimwishlist:item=3654674561&perks=1354429876,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick - Fourth Time's synergises perfectly with Dead Man's exotic perk, letting you fire a total of 22 rounds before needing to reload, as long as you're nailing all precision hits. Whilst this perk on this own makes this weapon exceptional, there is a better specific roll available if you care to keep grinding. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3654674561&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: PvP/Generalist roll. Vorpal  is exceptional on this weapon, turning it into a Super-melting machine in PvP, and performing really well in PvE, particularly in higher-end content when Scout Rifles are in the Champion meta. Just Vorpal makes this weapon stand out, regardless of the rest of your perks, but a better roll is available if you care to keep grinding. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Deafening Whisper
dimwishlist:item=981718087&perks=3300816228,#notes:Rostopher: Auto-Loading Holster on this weapon is great, and the weapon is strong enough despite its weird perk pool that this will carry it almost entirely. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Distant Tumulus
dimwishlist:item=2807687156&perks=1771339417,#notes:Rostopher: This weapon exists in a nether where it serves no purpose, given that the Ikelos Sniper exists. However, it is one of only a handful of weapons that can roll Firing Line, so is worth a look for that. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Dream Breaker
dimwishlist:item=2931957300&perks=4104185692#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Dream Breaker is the only Fusion that can currently roll Frenzy, which is just a fantastic perk on anything it rolls on, being a combined reload and damage perk. This opens up your Column 3 for a utility perk instead of a reload perk, which Dream Breaker does have a wide selection of, so have a read of what your Column 3 does, and see what you can do with it. Pick barrel and battery perks that enhance your stability, handling and magazine size, in that order.

// Empty Vessel
dimwishlist:item=4255586669&perks=960810156,#notes:Rostopher: Given the expansive perk pool on this weapon, the fact that you've snagged one with Danger Zone is at the very least interesting. One of only a few breech GLs that can roll it, this buff to blast radius is not to be sniffed at.
dimwishlist:item=4255586669&perks=3523296417,#notes:Rostopher: Given the expansive perk pool on this weapon, the fact that you've snagged one with Demolitionist is pretty good. Demolitionist pairs really well with breech grenade launchers, allowing you to fire, throw your grenade, then fire again, whilst kills with it will recharge your grenade, so it effectively feeds off itself. Worth keeping until you snag a better one.
dimwishlist:item=4255586669&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: Given the expansive perk pool on this weapon, the fact that you've snagged one with Vorpal Weapon is a minor miracle. The other perks might not be the best, but it's unique in being one of only 2 special GLs that can roll it, so might be worth hanging on to until you get a better one.

// Escape Velocity
dimwishlist:item=1786797708&perks=3643424744,#notes:Rostopher: Overflow is great on 900 RPM SMGs, and whilst better rolls are very much available of this weapon, the perk alone will carry it a long way. Pick the mag and scopes that best buff the stats to your liking, and be on the look out for a roll with Overflow/Vorpal. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1786797708&perks=1546637391#notes:Rostopher: God-tier roll of this weapon for general use. 900 SMGs tend to cook adds fairly quickly without a damage perk, and Vorpal will buff your efficacy against yellow bars something fierce. Pick the scope and mag perks that provides the best bonuses - ideally buffing magazine size and stability, and make do with your column 3 perk until you find one with Overflow. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Eternal Blazon
dimwishlist:item=3514096004&perks=3643424744,#notes:Rostopher: This weapon is fairly unique among scouts, in that it can have Overflow on it! Seeing as you've got this one, keep it for now, but be on the look out for more potentially useful rolls.
dimwishlist:item=3514096004&perks=1683379515#notes:Rostopher: S-tier PvE shield-cracker, this - particularly in combination with Anti-Barrier Scout Rifle should it be on the artefact. Disruption Break renders targets vulnerable to kinetic damage, which benefits both you and your team, which makes it a great nightfall weapon. Pick the scope you hate the least, and be on the look out for a similar roll with Armor-Piercing Rounds and Overflow. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Exile's Curse
dimwishlist:item=679281855&perks=1754714824,#notes:Rostopher: Kickstart is fairly unique - only able to roll on a handful of fusions, and is an enormous amount of fun to use. Whilst the rest of the perks here aren't fully optimal, you may find some fun with this weapon in both PvE and PvP.

// Exile's Curse (Adept)
dimwishlist:item=276080079&perks=1754714824,#notes:Rostopher: Kickstart is fairly unique - only able to roll on a handful of fusions, and is an enormous amount of fun to use. Whilst the rest of the perks here aren't fully optimal, you may find some fun with this weapon in both PvE and PvP.

// Eyasluna
dimwishlist:item=235827225&perks=3523296417#notes:The Warmind: PvE buildcrafter pick. Whilst Demolitionist here is replacing some very potent perks in column 3, on a hand cannon of this calibre in combination with a grenade generation build, you can't really go wrong with this perk. Have a read of your other primary trait and try to make use of it as best you can. For barrel and magazine perks, if you can, get the stability over 75 to give a super controllable weapon, otherwise spec into reload speed or magazine size. [Recommended MW: Stability or Reload]
dimwishlist:item=235827225&perks=124408337#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. An Eyasluna with Headstone is extremely strong, especially when paired with your Stasis subclass, if you have it, given its ability to proc your class' aspects and fragments. Have a read of your other primary trait and try to make use of it as best you can. For barrel and magazine perks, if you can, get the stability over 75 to give a super controllable weapon, otherwise spec into reload speed or magazine size. [Recommended MW: Stability or Reload]
dimwishlist:item=235827225&perks=3108830275#notes:The Warmind: Oddball pick. Whilst Unrelenting in Column 4 is kind of a dud perk, in Column 3 it becomes distinctly more interesting. Whilst on Eyasluna, it's replacing a few great reloader perks, being able to get 40% of your healtlh bar immediately returned to you upon securing successive kills is not to be sniffed at, particularly given that you have an 8 second window between kills to chain them. Particularly useful in mid-tier content where survivability becomes as important as damage output. [Recommended MW: Stability or Reload]

// Fatebringer
dimwishlist:item=2171478765&perks=3038247973#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Having Explosive in Column 3 is the thing that, in addition to its meaty base stats, makes Fatebringer unique, and hey look! You got that! There is no bad perk in Column 4, and whilst you don't have a PvP perk here, you've got a PvE starter for 10 at the very least, so have a read of what you got and try to utilise it as best you can. For your barrel and magazine perks, look to bump up your stability (ideally trying to hit 75 and above to make it a laser beam on both controller and M&K), then magazine size and reload speed after that. [Recommended MW: Reload or Stability]

dimwishlist:item=1216319404&perks=699525795#notes:The Warmind: Omnivore pick. You have here a great dual purpose roll that can be used in either PvE or PvP. For PvE, go with Explosive/Firefly; for PvP, go with Explosive/Eye of the Storm. EotS is underrated in PvP, especially in more competitive game modes where you'll primarily be engaging in duels. For your barrel and mag perks, look to increase your stability first (ideally if you can it ~75 stability, the thing becomes a laser beam on both controller and M&K), then increase your range as far as you can go. Failing that, go for handling or magazine size. [Recommended MW: Range or Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1216319404&perks=4104185692#notes:The Warmind: PvE utility pick. Frenzy is a 'good on everything' perk, and having it in combination with the guaranteed Explosive/Firefly gives you utility depending on what you're doing. Lower end content, where it's easy to secure kills, run Firefly and let the explosions fly. For higher-end stuff where it's going to take a few bullets for a kill, Frenzy will kick in, particularly if hand cannons are in the champion meta. [Recommended MW: Range or Stability]

// Found Verdict (Timelost)
dimwishlist:item=631439337&perks=2679249093#notes:The Warmind: PvE build-crafter pick. Whilst better One-Two Punch shotguns are available, this will absolutely work for these purposes should you not have another one. Combine with a melee-based build (think Tiny Hammer titan or Liars Handshake hunter). Barrels, if you have Full Choke, use that, otherwise any barrel that doesn't hurt handling will do fine (as long as it's not Smoothbore). Mags, more or less anything will do here - ideally something that extends your small magazine size, but it doesn't truly matter. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=631439337&perks=3418782618#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Unique to VoG weapons, Rewind Rounds is, if nothing else, an interesting perk. Whilst not quite as strong as Subsistence on something like The Comedian, it still allows you to dish out its chunky damage for longer. Combine it with the guaranteed Vorpal that you got for big damage to yellow-bar combatants. [Recommended MW: Handling or Reload]

// Frozen Orbit
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=2551157718,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Given the wild perk pool on this weapon, you sometimes have to take what you're given, and Box Breathing is a nice consolation prize if you couldn't get Vorpal [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=957782887,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Given the wild perk pool on this weapon, you sometimes have to take what you're given, and Snapshot negates a lot of the downsizes of running an Aggressive Frame sniper. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Given the wild perk pool on this weapon, you sometimes have to take what you're given, and this is one of only a small number of snipers that can roll Vorpal, so this is worth keeping. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Grenade Launcher
dimwishlist:item=153950757&perks=474269988,3300816228,3301904089#notes:Rostopher: Whilst better specific rolls may be available on this, Spike Grenades combined with Auto-Loading Holster is extremely valuable on breech GLs, usable in tandem with other weapons to put out significant amounts of damage. You may not have THE god roll of this weapon, but this will be entirely serviceable for pretty much any boss encouter. Hang onto this until you get a better one. [Recommended MW: Velocity or Handling]
dimwishlist:item=153950757&perks=474269988,3032599245,3300816228#notes:Rostopher: Whilst better specific rolls may be available on this, Blinding Grenades combined with Auto-Loading Holster is extremely valuable on breech GLs. You may not have THE god roll of this weapon, but this will be entirely serviceable all the way up to the hardest difficulties of content. Hang onto this until you get a better one. [Recommended MW: Velocity or Handling]
dimwishlist:item=153950757&perks=474269988,3301904089,2869569095#notes:Rostopher: Having both Spike and Field Prep on a breech GL is terrific for boss DPS. Just crouch, fire, reload super fast, fire again. Whilst you can't combine it with the damage from other weapons, the lightning fast reload makes up for that deficit by getting the damage of this weapon out faster. [Recommended MW: Reload or Velocity]

// Half-Truths
dimwishlist:item=3257091166&perks=2077819806#notes:The Warmind: Eager Edge is literally the only selling point of this weapon, and hey look! You got that! Congrats! Now go ZOOM.

// Hawkmoon
dimwishlist:item=3856705927&perks=2846385770#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Rangefinder on Hawkmoon turns it into an insanely sticky hand cannon in crucible. You'll land shots you absolutely do not expect to - just don't get to used to the work it's doing for you! The barrel and grip perks could be better, but in truth, this will perform perfectly thanks to Hawkmoon's ridiculous base stats.
dimwishlist:item=3856705927&perks=2450788523#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Hawkmoon's random perks don't have much in the way of amazing PvE perks, but Killing Wind is probably the closest. The barrel and grip perks could be better, but in truth, this will perform perfectly thanks to Hawkmoon's ridiculous base stats.

// Heretic
dimwishlist:item=3067821200&perks=3927722942#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Lasting Impression is both hilarious AND powerful, a rare combination, bumping up your damage - albeit on a small delay - and increasing the size of the blast radius. Direct hit bosses, or shoot it on the floor in front of an onrushing wave of adds, it's up to you. Better perk options are available in column 3, but this is worth holding on to until you have a better roll. A lot of people will tell you that Impact Casing is essential, but in real terms, it's only increasing your damage output by ~2%. If you have it, use it, but otherwise just pick whichever launcher and mag perks enhance velocity and blast radius. [Recommended MW: Reload]

// Hero of Ages
dimwishlist:item=2139640995&perks=2396489472#notes:The Warmind: Chain Reaction on a sword is a hilarious good time, allowing you to scythe through clouds of adds with minimal ammo usage.
dimwishlist:item=2139640995&perks=3523296417#notes:The Warmind: Uniquely among swords, this can roll Demolitionist, and whilst half of the perk is wasted (can't reload a sword!), it's made up for by a sword's intrinsic ability to easily secure kills, with no more than 10 kills needed (and much less depending on your discipline) to fully recharge your grenade. Combine with a grenade-heavy build for bonus points.
dimwishlist:item=2139640995&perks=4049631843#notes:The Warmind: A sword's intrinsic ability to chain damage between targets plays extremely well with One for All. Slice through 3 enemies, and get rewarded with a 35% boost to your damage!
dimwishlist:item=2139640995&perks=3108830275,4049631843#notes:The Warmind: A sword's intrinsic ability to chain damage between targets plays extremely well with both One for All and Unrelenting, for a surprisingly synergistic roll of this weapon. Slice through 3 enemies, immediately gain back a chunk of your health (assuming you killed those 3 things) and get rewarded with a 35% boost to your damage!
dimwishlist:item=2139640995&perks=3108830275#notes:The Warmind: A sword's intrinsic ability to chain kills plays extremely well into Unrelenting, particular here where it's not replacing any of the damage-enhancing perks in Column 4. Have a read of what you got there, and slice accordingly.

// Hezen Vengeance
dimwishlist:item=4050645223&perks=3643424744#notes:Rostopher: Hezen Vengeance is unique among rockets in its ability to roll Overflow, and whilst there are better rolls available with the perk, this is worth holding on to until you get one.

// Hezen Vengeance (Timelost)
dimwishlist:item=1921159786&perks=3300816228#notes:The Warmind: Given that the Timelost variant of this weapon is guaranteed to roll with Overflow and Cluster Bomb, the fact that you also got Auto-Loading Holster makes for a great utility weapon that can be adapted depending on what you're doing with it.  For your barrel and magazine perks, look to enhance your reload speed and velocity where possible. [Recommended MW: Any]

You also got Impact Casing, which gives you a small bump to your rockets total damage. For your barrel perks, look to enhance either handling or velocity where possible. [Recommended MW: Any]

// High Albedo
dimwishlist:item=1197486957&perks=2450788523#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Burst sidearms are hugely underrated in PvP, with a ludicrously low BODY SHOT TTK that puts most other weapons to shame. In particular, this one's ability to roll Killing Wind makes it incredibly dangerous. Almost any perk in Column 4 will work well in Crucible, so keep what you have. It'll also be no slouch in PvE, making this a great generalist roll. Pick barrel and magazine perks that enhance its stability and range. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Hollow Words
dimwishlist:item=607191995&perks=1546637391#notes:Rostopher: Generalist pick. Whilst Hollow Words is not quite as good as the similar Plug One, it does have some small advantages over the nightfall weapon, such as its ability to roll Vorpal Weapon, which hey look! You got! Whilst better specific rolls are available, you may wish to hold on to this one for now until you secure one. [Recommended MW: Any except Charge Time]

// Ignition Code
dimwishlist:item=304659313&perks=3161816588#notes:Rostopher: Ignition Code is unique among breech GLs in its ability to roll Slideshot, allowing you to slide to reload instead of going through the lengthy reload animation. Whilst the other perks here aren't wildly brilliant, this will be fun to hang on to until you find a better roll.

// Judgment
dimwishlist:item=1476654960&perks=3523296417#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Demolitionist in Column 3 is something of a rarity, and there no bad picks in column 4 in combination with this, so have a look at what you got, and try to make use of it accordingly. Look for magazine perks that bump up your magazine size, and barrel perks pretty much anything will do. [Recommended MW: Stability or Range]

// Lonesome
dimwishlist:item=2199171672&perks=4267945040#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Full Auto Trigger System is the best perk for this weapon in Column 3 for PvE, and there's very few bad choices in Column 4. Whilst better specific rolls are available, this will work if you care to make use of it.

// Loud Lullaby
dimwishlist:item=3924212056&perks=4104185692#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Column 3 is a very mixed bag for PvE on this weapon, but since Frenzy is both a damage and reload perk, you can more or less settle for anything there. Pick magazine and barrel perks that speed up your reload, or enhance your mag size or stability. [Recommended MW: Range or Handling]

// Matador 64
dimwishlist:item=2563012876&perks=1047830412,2679249093#notes:The Warmind: PvE buildcrafter pick. If you like melee-focused builds, whilst there are better One-Two Punch shotguns available (ideally you want a Lightweight shotgun for their snappy handling), this one will do you if you don't have a better one. You also have Full Choke which makes it easy to ensure all your pellets land. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Nation of Beasts
dimwishlist:item=654370424&perks=3038247973#notes:Rostopher: There are very few bad rolls on this weapon, and this one is one of the better ones for higher tier PvE content. Explosive payload ramps up your damage in PvE by about 11%, and also has the added benefit of counting as two hits, which combines superbly with hand cannon champion mods. Whilst slightly better specific rolls are available, Explosive Payload carries it a fair way all on its own, so it's worth keeping until you find a better one. [Recommended MW: Stability or Reload]

// Night Watch
dimwishlist:item=3504336176&perks=3038247973#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. In higher-tier content where you're not able to secure a lot of kills, Explosive Payload is fantastic on guns, as it is a de-facto ~12% buff to your damage output on all targets. It's particularly great when scout rifles are in the champion meta. Whilst better specific rolls will be available with EP, this'll do for until you get a better one. There are basically no bad choices in column 3, so make do with what you have, and try to maximise your stability, handling and recoil direction with your barrel and mag perks. [Recommended MW: Handling or Stability]

// Null Composure
dimwishlist:item=1644680957&perks=#notes:Banshee-44: Hrm, don't remember making this one. Void? I thought it was arc… no… that was something else… still I guess the burst will do good if you're not facing the strongest the darkness'll throw at you. Reckon you wanna reload it fast more than make it more stable, but that's just me...

// Omniscient Eye
dimwishlist:item=3454326177&perks=3096702027#notes:Rostopher: High-end PvE pick. Whilst generally speaking, if you need a solar rapid fire sniper rifle in high-difficulty content, you'll probably want to run the Ikelos sniper, if you're not running a warmind cell build, this is an entirely viable pick, particularly given that if you're using it as a shield-cracking weapon, you won't expend ammo doing so. Column 4 is a bit of a mixed bag for high-end content, but Genesis being as strong as it is, you can make do with whatever it is. Pick barrel and mag perks that enhance your magazine size, stability and handling. [Recommended MW: Stability or Handling]

// One Small Step
dimwishlist:item=1016668089&perks=3300816228#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Whilst pellet shotguns are generally less preferable to slugs for PvE these days, if you're just running around in strikes or other low level content where it doesn't matter that you're doing OPTIMAL DPS, then you can do a lot worse than this shotgun. Auto-Loading Holster allows you to stow it to reload, meaning you can always have it ready to go when you need it. There are no truly bad picks in Column 4 here, so have a read of what you got and try to make use of it as best you can. For magazine perks, anything that extends your magazine size is great, otherwise go with whatever. For barrels, avoid Full Choke (which lowers your potential damage output) but otherwise, anything will do. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Outrageous Fortune
dimwishlist:item=4146702548&perks=1716000303#notes:The Warmind: PvE oddball pick. Outrageous Fortune is unique in its ability to roll Concussion Grenades, which are basically single-target blinding grenades, and the effect lasts longer than blinding grenades do. You might not have the very best roll in combination with these, but this is still worth a look in thanks to this unique perk. [Recommended MW: Any]

// PLUG ONE.1
dimwishlist:item=1289000550&perks=,2726471870#notes:Rostopher: PvE buildcrafter pick. Plug One is one of the most satisfying fusions in the game, both from a performance and aesthetic perspective, and you have here an excellent roll for PvE, particularly if you have a super-focused build. Thresh gives you 1.5% super energy per kill, and for these purposes, there are no bad picks in Column 3, so remember to read the description of your perk there, and try to make use of it. Go for a barrel perk that maximises your stability if possible, and you can use pretty much any battery perk you like, this'll be very effective regardless. [Recommended MW: Stability or Handling]

// Prophet of Doom
dimwishlist:item=4020742303&perks=2679249093#notes:The Warmind: PvE buildcrafter pick. Whilst pellet shotguns largely pale in comparison to slugs for PvE, One-Two Punch is great for combining with melee-based builds (Tiny Hammer Titan, Liars Handshake Hunter, etc.). There is no bad pick in column 3 for these purposes, so have a read of what you got and try to make use of it. Look for Assault Mag if you have it, otherwise more or less anything in Col 2 is fine, and for Col 1, just avoid Full Choke, otherwise anything is also fine. [Recommended MW: Handling or Range]

// Punching Out
dimwishlist:item=378498222&perks=4104185692#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. SUROS rapid-fire sidearms are underrated little gems, and whilst it's perhaps disappointing that this one is also solar, it's still a fun to have a pocket auto-rifle at your disposal. This one at least has a somewhat more varied and interesting perk pool than The Fool's Remedy. Frenzy is a 'Good on Everything' perk that opens up your other slot for more utility picks, as it's both a reload, handling and damage perk all in one. [Recommended MW: Stability or Range]

This one at least has a somewhat more varied and interesting perk pool than The Fool's Remedy. Rangefinder is almost invariable good on sidearms, and this is no exception, pushing your maximum range out by 1.5 metres, so you can hit harder from further away.

// Reed's Regret
dimwishlist:item=1399243961&perks=3400784728#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Uniquely among Linear Fusion Rifles, Reed's can roll Triple Tap, which conjures ammunition out of thin air for sustained DPS. You might not have the best column 4 perk, but this is still worth keeping solely on the basis of this one perk. [Recommended MW: Handling, Stability or Reload]

// Servant Leader
dimwishlist:item=1107446438&perks=1354429876#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Given the sheer volume of perks available on this weapon, the fact that you managed to snag one with FTTC is pretty decent. FTTC works incredibly well on Rapid Fire scouts, especially if they're in the champion meta, so this'll be worth holding on to even if your other perks are somewhat lacking. Look for barrel and magazine perks that enhance stability, handling and magazine size - you do not need more range on this thing. [Recommended MW: Handling or Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1107446438&perks=4104185692#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick.

dimwishlist:item=1107446438&perks=1015611457#notes:The Warmind: Omnivore pick. Given the sheer volume of perks available on this weapon, the fact that you managed to snag one with Kill Clip is great.

In addition, this is a rare appearance of Demolitionist in column 3 instead of 4, giving it dual utility. Your final perk isn't the best possible, but Demolitionist carries the weapon a fair way all by itself, so it's worth keeping until you find a better roll.

You can push this out futher with range-enhancing barrels and magazines too, and it can reach up to 42 metres (up from base 35) with the right combination of perks and masterwork.

// Waking Vigil
dimwishlist:item=334171687&perks=1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvE high-end pick.

There's no bad picks for these purposes in Column 3, so make sure to read the description of the perk you have. For magazine perks, look to enhance your range and reload speed, and for scopes, pick whichever one feels best to you. [Recommended MW: Reload]

// Wastelander M5
dimwishlist:item=1679868061&perks=2679249093#notes:The Warmind: PvE buildcrafter pick. One-Two Punch is reasonably rare on kinetic shotguns, so this immediately has value based on that, despite better specific rolls being available for it. Combine it with Tiny Hammer titan or Liar's Handshake hunter for best results. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=1679868061&perks=1820235745#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Subsistence is pretty rare on shotguns, and so is a great pick straight out the gate with this weapon.

// Zephyr
dimwishlist:item=3400256755&perks=3650930298#notes:The Warmind: Without Cold Steel, Zephyr is just another adaptive sword and pales in comparison to the potential of others. However, with Cold Steel, it becomes immediately interesting, given that it’s a method of applying stacks of Slow, and even freezing targets, without having to use your abilities. Thus, this weapon has value straight out the gate, even your other perks are less than optimal, it's worth keeping purely on the strength of this one perk.

dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=1631667848,4082225868#notes:The Warmind: PvE oddball pick. Grave Robber and Swashbuckler in combination are a beautifully synergistic combo, and will work on pretty much any weapon, albeit only in activities where there is the potential to punch one guy, then unleash on the next.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=2450788523,3511092054#notes:The Warmind: PvP oddball pick. This is an interesting perk combination on almost any weapon, in combination with a Stasis subclass, as when you secure a kill, Elemental Capacitor and Killing Wind in together allow you to move so fast when aimed down sights that you can effectively break the game's aim assist mechanic to 'lock on' to you. Whilst this might not be the best weapon to pair with this, it's worth giving a shot with a Stasis subclass in PvP to see how it goes!
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=1168162263,4082225868#notes:The Warmind: PvE basic bitch roll. This combination of perks is great on literally everything. Outlaw gives you a speedy reload on a precision kill, and Swashbuckler kicks up your damage with each successive kill, up to a maximum of 33%. Whilst better specific rolls may be available, this one is worth a look in on this basis alone.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=3643424744,4049631843#notes:The Warmind: Overflow combined with any damage perk that doesn't require you to reload is just terrific, as if you're smart, you can keep the uptime for the damage perk insanely high. You want to try to get magazine perks that enhance your magazine capacity (Appended, Extended and Tactical all work great), and pretty much any barrel perks.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=247725512,4049631843#notes:The Warmind: PvE basic bitch roll. Feeding Frenzy and One for All synergise really nicely.

dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=247725512,4082225868#notes:The Warmind: PvE basic bitch roll. Rapid Hit and Swashbuckler synergise really nicely - precision shots give you an increasing stability and reload speed bump, and Swashbuckler bumps up your damage after each successive kill, and also allows you to get the max x5 stack from a melee kill. Whilst better specific rolls may be available on this weapon, this is worth keeping on the strength of that synergy.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=1820235745,4104185692#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Subsistence in combination with a damage perk is almost universally excellent on all weapons - as the damage perk ramps up your damage, you take less bullets to kill a target, which means the returned bullets to your magazine from Subsistence have more impact. Frenzy also gives you a cheeky reload speed bonus if you do manage to reach the bottom of the mag. Look to increase your magazine size further with your magazine perk, and more or less any of your column 1 perks will be just fine.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=1820235745,4082225868#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Subsistence in combination with a damage perk is almost universally excellent on all weapons - as the damage perk ramps up your damage, you take less bullets to kill a target, which means the returned bullets to your magazine from Subsistence have more impact. Look to increase your magazine size further with your magazine perk, and more or less any of your column 1 perks will be just fine.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=2779035018,1015611457#notes:The Warmind: PvE basic bitch roll. Feeding Frenzy and Kill Clip synergise really nicely. Escalating reload speed increase on successive kills, and big damage bump if you do reload. Whilst better specific rolls may be available, this is worth keeping on the strength of this synergy.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=2779035018,2458213969#notes:The Warmind: PvE basic bitch roll. Feeding Frenzy and Multi-Kill Clip synergise really nicely. Escalating reload speed increase on successive kills, and escalating damage increase based on the number of kills you did secure before reloading. Whilst better specific rolls may be available, this is worth keeping on the strength of this synergy.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=2779035018,3425386926#notes:The Warmind: PvE basic bitch roll. Feeding Frenzy and Rampage synergise really nicely. Escalting damage and reload speed bumps upon each successive kill feels really great, and keeps you pumping out high damage bullets, especially when paired with Rampage Spec. Better specific rolls may be available, but this is worth keeping purely on the strength of that synergy.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=2779035018,4082225868#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Feeding Frenzy and Swashbuckler combine very nicely for PvE - ramping up your damage and reload speed as you secure successive kills. Conveniently, they also both stack to 5, which is deeply satisfying for some unknown reason. Whilst better specific rolls may be available on this weapon, this is worth keeping based purely on the synergy of these two perks.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=1168162263,2848615171#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Whilst Dragonfly is a little bit of a duff perk in terms of damage output, it's very fun to use in lower-end PvE where enemies will fall over if you sneeze at them, and Outlaw synergises very well with it, giving you a snappy reload after an explode-y kill. Whilst better specific rolls may be available on this weapon, this synergy is worth holding on to for goofing around in strikes.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=1168162263,1015611457#notes:The Warmind: PvE basic bitch roll. This combination of perks is great on literally everything. Outlaw gives you a speedy reload on a precision kill, and Kill Clip gives you a 33% damage buff if you reload after a kill. Classic synergy right here, and whilst better specific rolls may be available on the weapon, this'll do sigificant work.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=1168162263,2458213969#notes:The Warmind: PvE basic bitch roll. This combination of perks is great on literally everything. Outlaw gives you a speedy reload on a precision kill, and Multi-Kill Clip gives you an increasing damage buff after reloading, depending on how many kills you secured before doing so. There may be better specific rolls available on this weapon, but this is worth keeping on this basis.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=1168162263,3425386926#notes:The Warmind: PvE basic bitch roll. This combination of perks is great on literally everything. Outlaw gives you a speedy reload on a precision kill, and Rampage kicks up your damage with each successive kill, up to a maximum of 30%. Whilst better specific rolls may be available, this one is worth a look in on this basis alone.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=3643424744,4104185692#notes:The Warmind: Overflow combined with any damage perk that doesn't require you to reload is just terrific, as if you're smart, you can keep the uptime for the damage perk insanely high. You want to try to get magazine perks that enhance your magazine capacity (Appended, Extended and Tactical all work great), and pretty much any barrel perks.

Whilst Dragonfly is a little bit of a duff perk in terms of damage output, it's very fun to use in lower-end PvE where enemies will fall over if you sneeze at them, and Rapid Hit synergises very well with it, giving you a snappy reload after successive critical hits. Whilst better specific rolls may be available on this weapon, this synergy is worth holding on to for goofing around in strikes.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=247725512,1015611457#notes:The Warmind: PvE basic bitch roll.

// Fatebringer
dimwishlist:item=2171478765&perks=3038247973,3824105627,#notes:Rostopher: Explosive/Firefly is the OG Destiny 1 roll of this weapon, and still holds up very well in Destiny 2's sandbox, particularly with the improvements made to Firefly. Whilst it's not incredible in high level endgame content, it'll be a great workhorse hand cannon in low and mid-tier activities. [Recommended MW: Reload or Stability]

// Fatebringer (Timelost)
dimwishlist:item=1216319404&perks=3038247973,3824105627#notes:The Warmind: Straight out the gate, a Timelost Fatebringer is a great PvE weapon, given that it guaranteed rolls with Explosive/Firefly. You can umm and ahh about the magazine and barrel perks, and what additional primary traits you got, but at the end of it, slap these two on and go to town in PvE. [Recommended MW: Range or Stability]

// Grenade Launcher
dimwishlist:item=153950757&perks=474269988,3032599245,3301904089#notes:The Warmind: Having both spike and blinding grenades on a breech grenade launcher is one of the best possible combinations, giving you the choice between a utility weapon and a DPS machine, even if you do have to reload it manually. Worth keeping, regardless of the other perks, but better specific rolls will be available. [Recommended MW: Velocity or Handling]
dimwishlist:item=153950757&perks=474269988,3032599245#notes:The Warmind: Whilst better rolls are available, Blinding Grenades is extremely strong on breech GLs, so even though you might need to reload this manually, you can still get significant value out of this weapon, regardless of the other perks. [Recommended MW: Velocity or Handling]
dimwishlist:item=153950757&perks=3301904089,3300816228#notes:The Warmind: Auto-Loading and Spike an a heavy GL is great for boss DPS. Empty your magazine, stow it and do damage with another weapon, wait for the 'click' that indicates it's reloaded (it takes ~3 seconds), then whip it out again and go to town. Rinse and repeat until target is dead or you're out of ammo. Better specific rolls of this weapon may be available, so keep a look out, but otherwise, this will be entirely serviceable. [Recommended MW: Handling or Velocity]
dimwishlist:item=153950757&perks=3301904089,2869569095#notes:The Warmind: Field Prep and Spike is great on a heavy GL for boss DPS. Crouch, fire until empty, then reload lightning fast and fire again. Rinse and repeat until you are empty or your target is dead. Better specific rolls of this weapon may be available, so keep a look out, but otherwise, this will be entirely serviceable. [Recommended MW: Handling or Velocity]

// Shotgun
dimwishlist:item=11&perks=1300023272,791862061,47981717#notes:The Warmind: PvP pick. For a more reactive shotgun, this is immediately a 3/5 roll which will perform reasonably well in PvP. It will lack the consistency for one-hit kills compared to a Full Choke/Accurized roll, but it makes up for that with enhanced handling and the ability to fire follow-up shots faster, making it great for cleaning up weak opponents, especially given the presence of Opening Shot [Recommended MW: Handling or Range]
dimwishlist:item=11&perks=1300023272,791862061#notes:The Warmind: PvP pick.

dimwishlist:item=11&perks=1047830412,3142289711,47981717#notes:The Warmind: PvP pick. Full Choke, Accurized and Opening shot will do the majority of the work in helping you secure kills outside of 5 metres. Read the description of the perk in column 4 and whilst it may not be ideal, try to make use of it as best you can. [Recommended MW: Handling or Range]
dimwishlist:item=11&perks=1047830412,3142289711,3161816588#notes:The Warmind: PvP pick.

dimwishlist:item=11&perks=1047830412,3142289711#notes:The Warmind: PvP pick. For a consistent as hell shotgun, this will do as a starter for 10. Whilst its primary traits may not be the best possible on this particular weapon, any shotgun that has the combination of Full Choke and Accurized Rounds will push its effective range out as far as possible, and keeping the spread tight when you ADS means more consistently landing pellets. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=11&perks=3300816228,2360754333#notes:The Warmind: Shotguns with Auto-Loading and Trench are, generally, quite good in PvE. Pull it out, punch a guy, then pump out three big-damage shots. Holster it and go back to your day. You want magazine perks that enhance magazine size; or Assault Mag for faster damage output. The only barrel perk you want to avoid with this roll is Full Choke, which reduces precision damage. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Sword
dimwishlist:item=54&perks=1749209109,3913600130#notes:The Warmind: Any sword with Relentless and Whirlwind is worth keeping. Landing light attacks ramps up your damage, and returns ammo, what's not to love? [Recommended MW: Impact]

// Any
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=3824105627#notes:The Warmind: Firefly alone on any weapon is really good, given it has both a damage effect and a reload speed buff on precision kills, and also means that the weapon can spawn warmind cells if you can secure kills with the Firefly explosion, thanks to the Wrath of Rasputin mod. Whilst better specific rolls will be available, this one is worth holding on to until you find them.

// The Hothead (Adept)
dimwishlist:item=1866778462&perks=2869569095#notes:The Warmind: PvE pick. Given that the Adept variant of this weapon rolls with Tracking Module as well as another perk, the fact that you got Field Prep gives this weapon some really nice multi-purpose utility in PvE. Need to hit something far away? Tracking. Doing DPS to a stationary(-ish) boss? Field Prep. Just remember to pop a crouch before you go town to take advantage of that speedy reload. [Recommended MW: Reload or Handling]

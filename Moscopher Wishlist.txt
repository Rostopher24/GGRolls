dimwishlist:item=3325778512&perks=839105230,1968497646,3300816228,4049631843#notes:Rostopher: Finally, a 450 RPM solar MG that doesn't look ridiculous! Or not. Anyway, this is a great PvE pick. Auto-Loading is great on MGs, bypassing their lengthy reload animations, and One for All is basically free on MGs; particularly with Armor-Piercing, which can get multiple hits with one bullet, proccing one for all faster. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=3325778512&perks=839105230,2420895100,3300816228,4049631843#notes:Rostopher: Finally, a 450 RPM solar MG that doesn't look ridiculous! Or not. Anyway, this is a great PvE pick. Auto-loading is great on MGs, particularly in combination with Extended Mag, as you bypass the slow reload, and get 69 (nice) bullets in the mag. Arrowhead Brake keeps the weapon under control, and One for All is basically free to proc on MGs, for a massive damage boost. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=3325778512&perks=839105230,2420895100,1820235745,4104185692#notes:Rostopher: Finally, a 450 RPM solar MG that doesn't look ridiculous! Or not. Anyway, this is a great PvE pick. Because of the massive magazine from Extended Mag, Subsistence works really well here, and Frenzy being both a damage and reload perk really helps in the unlikely event that you do need to reload. Arrowhead Brake keeps the weapon under control. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Abide the Return
dimwishlist:item=1644160541&perks=3666208348,269888150,1749209109,2726471870#notes:Rostopher: Abide the Return…returns, and it brings with it a slightly inferior perk package than it had before. That said, it's one of only a handful of swords that can roll thresh, and that has a fair amount of value, and this one is a 4/4 keeper.
dimwishlist:item=1644160541&perks=3666208348,269888150,2590710093,2726471870#notes:Rostopher: Abide the Return…returns, and it brings with it a slightly inferior perk package than it had before.

That said, it's one of only a handful of swords that can roll thresh, and that has a fair amount of value. Whilst this isn't THE roll - you want both Swordmaster's Guard and Jagged edge - this'll do until you get it.

// Accrued Redemption
dimwishlist:item=4095896073&perks=852209214,3827198035,201365942,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: This is the discerning bow-users roll. Buffs to accuracy from the string and arrow perks, alongside the classic Archer's Tempo/Rampage combo. This bow is rare as hell, and this is a perfect roll on it, so whack a rampage spec on it, and keep it. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Adored
dimwishlist:item=4184808992&perks=3250034553,3142289711,3400784728,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: Adored is a great generalist sniper - Triple Tap and Vorpal makes it potent in PvE (though better snipers are available, though not in Arc flavour), and Killing Wind/Snapshot makes it excellent in PvP. A keeper for sure.

// Age-Old Bond
dimwishlist:item=601592879&perks=1467527085,679225683,1354429876,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Whilst 360 autos aren't exactly optimal weapons, this curated roll works just fine. It's got a ton of range, so can be useful for cracking void shields at range, and pairs really nicely with Anti-Barrier Auto Rifle when it's on the artefact. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Ancient Gospel
dimwishlist:item=48643186&perks=4090651448,106909392,1168162263,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Ancient Gospel is a great little handcannon that'll do work wherever hand cannons are good. This roll is fully min/maxed to do work for you, with Outlaw and Kill Clip providing a lovely synergistic pairing, and Tactical Mag bumping up your magazine size and reducing your reload speed, to minimise your downtime. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=48643186&perks=1482024992,3142289711,699525795,2846385770#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 140s are almost always a competetive pick, particularly if you have the aim to let them sing, and this roll will do work for you at plenty of ranges. Eye of the Storm is an underrated perk for PvP, increasing your bullet magnetism as your health gets lower, which might give you the edge you need in a duel. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Apex Predator
dimwishlist:item=2545083870&perks=3525010810,3796465595,3977735242,3300816228#notes:Rostopher: Apex Predator is the runt of the rocket launcher family. It's perk selection is microscopic, its curated roll is weird at the best of times and it has largely been superceded by Code Duello. However, if you do have this particular roll, this is probably the absolute min-maxed DPS roll you can get, so hold onto it. [Recommended MW: Velocity]

// Apostate
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=839105230,106909392,1556840489,3038247973#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick for this otherwise mediocre weapon. Arrowhead sorts out the vaguely bizarre recoil direction, with Tac Mag bumping up your stablity, reload speed and mag size to acceptable ranges. Lead from Gold will keep you stocked up, and Explosive Payload is the only perk that increases damage per shot, rather than per kill. Half-decent, but Adored or Occluded Finality have much better PvE rolls available. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=4090651448,3142289711,2866798147,47981717#notes:Rostopher: If you're mad enough to want to use this weapon in PvP, this is probably the best roll you can find. Bear in mind that you'll need, count 'em, THREE body shots to kill a guardian if you miss the headshot, so make sure you're landing those headshots, and with this roll, it's just a little bit more forgiving to do so. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=1840239774,3142289711,2866798147,47981717#notes:Rostopher: If you're mad enough to want to use this weapon in PvP, this is probably the best roll you can find. Bear in mind that you'll need, count 'em, THREE body shots to kill a guardian if you miss the headshot, so make sure you're landing those headshots, and with this roll, it's just a little bit more forgiving to do so. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Arc Logic
dimwishlist:item=2723909519&perks=839105230,3142289711,1570042021,3592538738#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 600s still do work in PvP, and Arc Logic is a fairly typical 600. Being arc is great against pesky Heir Apparent users too. Arrowhead will help keep your weapon under control, Accurized pushes your effective range out to 24 metres, and Heating Up makes you more and more accurate as you rack up the kills. Normally I'd recommend a damage perk, but both those available on this weapon are difficult to proc in PvP, so Wellspring naturally steps up to the plate, being extremely solid for your neutral game. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=2723909519&perks=839105230,106909392,2450788523,4104185692#notes:Rostopher: PvE Pick. Arc Logic is back, and whilst in principle it's just an arc Gnawing Hunger, it's recoil tends a little more strongly to the left, so may feel a bit odd in comparision. Arrowhead Brake on this roll sorts that out somewhat, and Tac Mag is the GOAT PvE mag choice. Frenzy being a reload and damage perk in one opens up your column 3 for a utility pick, and Killing Wind is absolutely the best of those available for PvE. [Recommended MW: Reload]

// Archon's Thunder
dimwishlist:item=1967303408&perks=839105230,106909392,3513791699,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: This here is the best roll available on this weapon. Arrowhead Brake sorts out its weird recoil pattern, Tactical Mag buffs the magazine size, reload speed and stability, and Mulligan/Rampage is a pretty tasty combo for those of us who like to shoot but sometimes miss things. [Recommended MW: Reload]

// Arctic Haze
dimwishlist:item=20935540&perks=4090651448,106909392,2450788523,2848615171#notes:Rostopher: Generalist PvE pick. Corkscrew Rifling is the best all-rounder barrell option, buffing stablity, handling and range all at once; Tac Mag bumps your magazine size, stablity and reload speed. Killing Wind/Dragonfly is a great perk combo for low-end content, keeping you mobile and exploding big crowds of enemies. [Recommended MW: Reload]
dimwishlist:item=20935540&perks=4090651448,106909392,3400784728,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: Min/Maxed PvE pick. Corkscrew Rifling is the best all-rounder barrell option, buffing stablity, handling and range all at once; Tac Mag bumps your magazine size, stablity and reload speed; and Triple Tap/Vorpal will see you burning down Yellow Bars and bosses in a beautifully efficient champion. Particularly good with Anti-Barrier Auto Rifle, but will do work without it as well. [Recommended MW: Reload]
dimwishlist:item=20935540&perks=3250034553,3142289711,2450788523,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Maximised range, with Killing Wind pushing it out even further upon kill and keeping you moving, and Vorpal Weapon allowing you to burn down supers surprisingly quickly. Don't sleep on this weapon. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Arsenic Bite-4b
dimwishlist:item=720351795&perks=852209214,3429800428,3425386926,201365942#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. The OG energy bow, the combo of Archer's Tempo and Rampage is a thing of beauty. Fiberglass Arrows max out your accuracy, and Polymer String gets your draw time down as far as possible, maximising your damage potention. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Astral Horizon
dimwishlist:item=1697682876&perks=1300023272,791862061,3300816228,2360754333#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Not that you'll likely use this weapon in PvE, but if you do happen upon this roll, it does do a fair amount of work (for example, it can 1-tap Oracles in Vault of Glass). Auto-Loading holster pairs very nicely with Trench Barrell, Assault Mag ramps up your fire rate, and Barrel Shroud gives you the biggest possible bump to handling, making sure you can whip it out quickly. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=1697682876&perks=1332244541,3142289711,3436462433,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Maximised range, bonus accuracy on the first shot of your attack, and a bump to handling from Surplus. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Astral Horizon (Adept)
dimwishlist:item=532746994&perks=1300023272,791862061,3300816228,2360754333#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Not that you'll likely use this weapon in PvE, but if you do happen upon this roll, it does do a fair amount of work. Auto-Loading holster pairs very nicely with Trench Barrell, Assault Mag ramps up your fire rate, and Barrel Shroud gives you the biggest possible bump to handling, making sure you can whip it out quickly. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=532746994&perks=1332244541,3142289711,3436462433,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Maximised range, bonus accuracy on the first shot of your attack, and a bump to handling from Surplus. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Bad Omens
dimwishlist:item=991314988&perks=1478423395,3796465595,3977735242,1275731761#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Bad Omens is a lovely rocket launcher that has, sadly been largely superceded by the superior Royal Entry. That said, this roll will be entirely functional at Blowing Shit Up™.  This is also the curated roll, so always worth hanging on to it. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Bequest
dimwishlist:item=3366545721&perks=3666208348,269888150,1749209109,354401740#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Holding the dubious honour of 'Perhaps most disappointing raid weapon', Bequest is a weapon that is very much style over substance. That said, Relentless Strikes and Assassin's Blade will be entirely functional in low-end content. Swordmaster's gets your heavy attack back faster, and Jagged Edge maximises your damage potential. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Bite of the Fox
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=4090651448,3142289711,957782887,588594999#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat cotentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=4090651448,3142289711,957782887,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat cotentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=1840239774,1087426260,247725512,2869569095#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst you probably have better PvE snipers than this, this roll will work in a variety of situations. Just remember to crouch when you reload. [Recommended MW: Reload]
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=3250034553,3142289711,957782887,588594999#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat cotentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=3250034553,3142289711,957782887,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat cotentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Biting Winds
dimwishlist:item=1621657423&perks=852209214,3827198035,2450788523,3350417888#notes:Rostopher: Biting Winds is a bit of an odd duck in the bow department. It's the only bow that cannot roll with Archer's Tempo, and so we must look elsewhere for utility. Killing Wind is rather good on pretty much everything, and Sympathetic Arsenal was designed for bows, given that you are always 'reloading' it when you nock an arrow. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]
dimwishlist:item=1621657423&perks=852209214,3827198035,247725512,4082225868#notes:Rostopher: Biting Winds is a bit of an odd duck in the bow department. It's the only bow that cannot roll with Archer's Tempo, and Rapid Hit feels like a poor replacement. However, this roll still gets the jop done, and as a bonus, you can punch a guy for a big stack of damage boost. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Blasphemer
dimwishlist:item=2782847179&perks=3250034553,3142289711,706527188,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. The curated roll of this weapon is a monstrous contender in PvP. If you like slug shotguns therein, you'll like this one. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Bonechiller
dimwishlist:item=4037745684&perks=1840239774,791862061,3300816228,3523296417#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst it's no First In, Last Out, this weapon still holds its own in PvE with this super interesting roll. Fire 6 shots, reload by throwing your grenade, fire 6 more, then stow it to let auto-loading kick in. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=4037745684&perks=1840239774,791862061,3400784728,3523296417#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst it's no First In, Last Out, this weapon still holds its own in PvE with this super interesting roll. Triple Tap lets you fire 7 shots before needing to reload, and reload you can with yeeting a grenade, for a total of 14 shots and your grenade damage in sweet sweet DPS. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=4037745684&perks=3250034553,3142289711,280464955,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst Bonechiller isn't as highly regarded as First In, Last Out or Blasphemer in PvP, this roll will work exceptionally well, particularly if you’re a sliding shotgun ape. Firmly Planted kicks in when you slide, then combines with the max range and opening shot to get unreasonably accurate murder. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Borrowed Time
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=839105230,1968497646,3643424744,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE god tier pick. Arrowhead makes the weapon incredibly controllable, Armor-Piercing makes the weapon do even more damage to shields, and will clean-up waves of weaker adds in a jiffy. Overflow is terrific on almost anything it rolls on, and the classic Rampage to round out the package. If you got this, you're enormously  lucky! Lock it and keep it. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=4090651448,1885400500,2450788523,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvP god tier pick. More or less maxed range, stability also maxed out - this thing hits for maximum damage at 18 meters, and Killing Wind will push that out even further. One stack of rampage reduces your TTK by 1 shot down to 7c1b/0.6 seconds as well. If you snagged this and like PvP, absolutely keep it. It'll do work in PvE too! [Recommended MW: Range]

// Bottom Dollar
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=4090651448,2420895100,1820235745,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Subsistence combined with Extended Mag is the only way Subsistence really works on this weapon - ensuring you get 2 bullets back instead of 1, you can basically fire it forever in low-end content. Each stack of Rampage will make sure that you're definitely killing everything in front of you, so you may never need to reload ever. Do note that this weapon will likely perform poorly in higher tier content - it's a red-bar slayer and not much more.
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=4090651448,106909392,1168162263,2458213969#notes:Rostopher: God tier roll here. Corkscrew Rifling gives you a flat buff to 3 stats with no downsides; Tac Mag gives you an extra bullet and a bonus to reload and stability; and Outlaw/Multi-Kill Clip is a perfectly synergistic 3rd and 4th. This thing hits like a train in both PvE and PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=3250034553,3142289711,2450788523,47981717#notes:Rostopher: An insane max-range roll for PvP here. You're sacrificing a damage perk for Opening Shot, but if you can combine it with High Energy Fire or other damage buffs, this thing has insane two-tap range, and is outrageously consistent in duels. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Brass Attacks
dimwishlist:item=2121785039&perks=3661387068,1431678320,3643424744,3350417888#notes:Rostopher: Not so much good as unique, this is the Season Pass roll of this weapon from Season of the Chosen, and features Overflow, which cannot roll on the weapon otherwise. So worth keeping purely on that basis.
dimwishlist:item=2121785039&perks=4090651448,1885400500,2450788523,4104185692#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Brass Attacks is a workhorse in PvE. With Frenzy, you don't really need a reload perk, as Frenzy IS a reload perk, so Killing Wind is the almost obvious replacement for Feeding Frenzy or Rapid Hit, pushing your range out ludicrously, and giving you the zoomies in the process. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=2121785039&perks=4090651448,1885400500,2450788523,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Aggressive Burst sidearms are hugely underrated in PvP, and Brass Attacks with this roll absolutely slaps. Rampage lowers your already ridiculously low TTK, and Killing Wind lets you compete at nearly auto-rifle ranges. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// BrayTech Werewolf
dimwishlist:item=528834068&perks=3250034553,1968497646,2387244414,2458213969#notes:Rostopher: This is the curated roll of this weapon, and is extremely reliable in both PvE and PvP. Hold onto this if you managed to snag it. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=528834068&perks=1482024992,1885400500,1359896290,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: Oddball PvP pick. Vorpal Weapon is great in PvP, and this weapon will keep you on target for long enough to absolutely mince enemy supers. Combine with High Energy fire for maximum carnage. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Cartesian Coordinate
dimwishlist:item=2481881293&perks=2405638014,1687452232,2779035018,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Feeding Frenzy plays will with rapid-fire fusions in low-end content, and Vorpal will help you put in some half-decent DPS to yellow-bar enemies. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=2481881293&perks=2405638014,1687452232,1631667848,4082225868#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Grave Robber/Swash is always a fun combo, and given the relatively short range of this fusion, you'll almost always be within punching distance of something, so your uptime on Swash will be terrific. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=2481881293&perks=2405638014,1687452232,1866048759,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. If you are insane enough to use this in PvP, then this roll will do some work.

Subsistence/Rampage is a terrific combination, with Rampage giving you better net return on each kill thanks to the increased damage. Tac Mag is a nice flat buff to Stability, Reload Speed and Mag Size, and Polygonal keeps your shot from bouncing all over the place like a lunatic. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Zen Moment is hugely underrated on this weapon, eliminating reticule shake completely as you deal damage with it, and Multikill Clip, whilst not quite as good as Kill Clip, is still a good damage buff that ramps up nicely.

Corkscrew Rifling does a nice flat buff to handling, stability and range, Light Mag keeps the reload snappy and pushes out your range; and Tunnel Vision locks your high-damage shots from Multi-Kill Clip onto the heads of your enemies.

This weapon is unique in that it can roll Disruption Break in Column 3, where normally it lands in column 4, meaning it can be paired with Rampage to serve a dual role of shield cracking and red-bar slaying. Armor-Piercing makes it hit shields harder, and the SRO-52 is the best all-rounder scope, featuring high zoom but retaining visibility for situation awareness.

Pulse Rifles will almost always be an at least half-decent pick in PvP, being both range-y and easy to use. This one in particular can two-burst someone with just one stack of Rampage, and Zen Moment keeps your bursts on target, assuming you land the first shot.

Full Auto Trigger System is the best perk for this weapon in Column 3 for PvE, and Swashbuckler pairs well with the weapon's close-range nature. Flared and Fluted make up for the weapons clunky handling and reload. Not an endgame weapon, but one you can certainly whip out when sidearm challenges or bounties pop up.

Whilst it may seem odd that I've selected the scope with the highest zoom, the Y4 changes to how sniper zoom affected aim assist means that on controller, high zoom is very much your friend, and even on M&K, if you can get to grips with the lowered field of view, this thing will land shots that you absolutely do not expect to.

Whilst better kinetic snipers are available, they are often harder to acquire, and this is an extremely solid pick for moments where you need one. Rapid Hit and Triple Tap synergise very well, allowing you to fire 7 rounds if you hit every crit before reloading lightning fast, even with defecit inflicted by Extended.

The Model 8 RED bumps your zoom up from 13 to 17, and whilst that doesn't sound like a lot, this scope alone pushes your effective range out by 8 whole metres. Combined with accurised rounds, this can touch up to 20 metres before damage drop-off. Killing Wind pushes that out even further when you secure a kill, and Kill Clip, when active, drops your TTK to a surreal 0.47 seconds, needing only 8 crits. An absolute gem of a PvP SMG, hold on to this one; it'll even do work in PvE if you let it. [Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling]

Ambitious Assassin and Multikill Clip feed into eachother beautiful, and your mag and barrel perks enhance the weapon's consistency and uptime. A great wee pick, especially if you don't have another.

That and Timed Payload combines very well with anti-champion mods, making it an outstanding weapon for high-end PvE content. Fourth Times the Charm keeps magazine topped up as you'r'e firing, and Tac Mag and Corkscrew keep the weapon feeling snappy and stable. Absolutely masterwork this.

You have here a bona-fide god roll for high difficulty content too - particularly when SMGs are in the champion meta. Fourth Time's the Charm seems like an odd choice on an SMG, but given how stable this thing is, it's easy to proc it and assuming you land all your crits, you'll be firing over 50 bullets before needing to reload.

These burst side arms are absolutely monstrous in PvE, and with One for All, as long as you're comfortable proccing it, it ramps the damage up by 35%. Ambitious Assassin will get you just so many bullets in the mag. Combine with Tac Mag and Shortspec for flat buffs to almost every stat, this will be an extremely reliable sidearm.

These burst sidearms are excellent in both PvE and PvP, with an extraordinary damage output within their range. Killing Wind will push that range out even further, and Kill Clip pushes your PvP TTK down to a ludicrous 0.43 seconds, and ramping up your damage in PvE. With Accurized and Target SAS, your pushing your range out even further. [Recommended MW: Range]

Auto-Loading is great on MGs, bypassing their lengthy reload animations, and One for All is basically free on MGs; particularly with Armor-Piercing, which can get multiple hits with one bullet, proccing one for all faster.

Spike/Auto-Loading/Field Prep, however, is a snappy PvE roll that'll work in almost any situation, with the extra reserves and fast reload on demand from Field Prep being particularly welcome.

Being arc is great against pesky Heir Apparent users too. Heating Up makes you more and more accurate as you rack up the kills.

Thus, try to pick mag perks that straighten up your recoil, or alternatively ones that buff stability.

dimwishlist:item=2742838701&perks=3643424744,4082225868,#notes:Rostopher: Dire Promise, the old crucible favourite, has this roll, which is great in PvE.

dimwishlist:item=1786797708&perks=3643424744,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: God-tier roll of this weapon for general use. 900 SMGs tend to cook adds fairly quickly without a damage perk, and Vorpal will buff your efficacy against yellow bars something fierce, and Overflow will let the bullets just keep firing, especially if you play smart.

dimwishlist:item=4277547616&perks=2846385770,2458213969#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst this weapon is not quite as good as the similar Trials weapon Shayura's Wrath, it is distinctly easier to acquire, the only downside being that it lacks the zoom that really pushes your range out on Shayura's. Still, this'll do at least a bit of work as a backup weapon to a sniper. Just one stack of Multikill Clip is enough to drop your optimal TTK to 0.7 seconds, requiring one less precision shot to secure the kill. Rangefinder will push your range out, up to a maximum of 21m depending on which perks and masterwork you have, so try to pick magazine and barrel perks that push your range out.

dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=3300816228,706527188,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Auto-Loading/Quickdraw is a nice perk combo, particularly for moments were you need to do a quick burst of DPS. [Recommended MW: Any]

dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=588594999,47981717,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Assuming you are comfotable with hard-scoping, rather than needing to quickscope, this roll has ungodly levels of aim assistance on the first shot fired. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=588594999,957782887,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Snapshot sights and Moving Target will offset the slow ADS speed, and provide a little bump to Aim Assistance, allowing you to nail those quickscopes. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Gnawing Hunger
dimwishlist:item=821154603&perks=1820235745,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Subsistence/Rampage is a terrific combination, with Rampage giving you better net return on each kill thanks to the increased damage.

dimwishlist:item=821154603&perks=2387244414,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick.

// Gridskipper
dimwishlist:item=1621558458&perks=2946784966,2458213969,#notes:Rostopher: Generalist pick. Gridskipper is the dark horse of Season of the Splicer, a pulse rifle that feels good even to folk who don't like pulses. Multi-Kill Clip and Tunnel Vision feature excellent synergy, and combined with the pulse's zippy fire rate, absolutely melts combatants and guardians alike, with the aim assist boost magnetising bullets to the crit spots of your foes.

// Heritage
dimwishlist:item=4248569242&perks=791862061,3300816228#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst this isn't quite THE roll of this weapon - lacking its signature perk reconstruction - Auto-Loading Holster is a very close second for a boss DPS pick, allowing you to empty the weapon (quickly thanks to Assault Mag), then stow it and fire another weapon while it reloads. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=4248569242&perks=791862061,1523832109#notes:Rostopher: You did it! You got THE roll of this shotgun for boss DPS. The perks in column 4 are a bit of a mixed bag - Recombination is probably the best, but really, as long as you've snagged the 2 marked perks, you'll be capable of doing an insane amount of damage to stationary bosses, particularly if you can hit their crit spots.  It'll also do work in more generalist situations, and you'll rarely if ever have to actually reload it. Pick a barrel mag that enhances your range as much as possible, and masterwork this immediately. [Recommended MW: Range or Handling]

// High Albedo
dimwishlist:item=1197486957&perks=2010801679,3523296417#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst High Albedo lacks a damage perk, adaptive frame sidearms are surprisingly strong in PvE all on their own, and High Albedo's incredible base stats make it feel great.

// Hollow Words
dimwishlist:item=607191995&perks=1556840489,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst Hollow Words is not quite as good as the similar Plug One, it does have some small advantages over the nightfall weapon, such as its ability to roll Vorpal Weapon, which hey look! You got! Lead from Gold ensures you'll pretty much always have ammo, and Liquid Coils makes it hit nearly as hard as High Impact Frames. Pretty much any barrel and battery perks will do, so pick the ones that have the least detriment to your weapon's stats. [Recommended MW: Any except Charge Time]

This'll be particularly useful when hand cannons are in the champion meta, and this roll utilises a couple of oddball perks to play into that.

This one won't perform particularly well in high end content, but in low- and mid-tier content, you'll be laughing as you never have to reload. Subsistence returns bullets to the magazine on kill, Rampage ramps up you damage on kill, combine the two and you're firing forever.

Whilst this one isn't particularly brilliant for high-end content (though it'll still perform well!), it'll do well in low- and mid-tier content. Triple Tap rewards successive crits with a round returned to the mag, and Rampage ramps up your damage output as you secure kills.

dimwishlist:item=3460122497&perks=201365942,4104185692#notes:Rostopher: Uniquely among bows, Imperial Needle can roll Frenzy, which can combine with Archer's Tempo for you to wildly fling arrows across the map at an astonishing rate. Look for the string and arrow perks that enhance your draw speed and accuracy - don't worry if the stability takes a hit. [Recommended MW: Accuracy or Draw Time]

// Interference VI
dimwishlist:item=2257180473&perks=33019040892888557110#notes:Rostopher: PvE DPS pick. Uniquely among GLs, this weapon can roll Full Court, which ramps up your damage the further the round travels. So congrats on getting one! There's no bad perk in column 3 on this weapon, so use what you have, and this'll be excellent for various bosses, especially if you've not yet snagged Anarchy. Just empty the drum, then reload and fire again until you run out of ammo, or the thing is dead. [Recommended MW: Velocity or Handling]

// Jian 7 Rifle
dimwishlist:item=1162247618&perks=1683379515,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. This weapon is unique in that it can roll Disruption Break in Column 3, where normally it lands in column 4, meaning it can be paired with Rampage to serve a dual role of shield cracking and red-bar slaying. Pick the magazine perks that enhance stability, handling and mag size, in that order, then grab the scope that you hate the least. [Recommended MW: Stability or Handling]
dimwishlist:item=1162247618&perks=2387244414,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Pulse Rifles will almost always be an at least half-decent pick in PvP, being both range-y and easy to use. This one in particular can two-burst someone with just one stack of Rampage, and Zen Moment keeps your bursts on target, assuming you land the first shot. Pick magazine perks that enhance your stability or range, and pick the scope that you hate the least. [Recommended MW: Stability or Handling]

// Last Perdition
dimwishlist:item=188882152&perks=1168162263,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Outlaw/Kill Clip is a classic PvE combo, and it works particularly well on this weapon.

dimwishlist:item=188882152&perks=2846385770,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Range finder more or less maxes your range out at around 50 metres, and with Kill Clip active, you only need to land 2 bursts to secure a kill. Pick barrel perks that enhance your range and stability, and pick the scope that has the highest zoom that you can stomach. [Recommended MW: Stability or Handling]

// Lonesome
dimwishlist:item=2199171672&perks=4267945040,4082225868#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Full Auto Trigger System is the best perk for this weapon in Column 3 for PvE, and Swashbuckler pairs well with the weapon's close-range nature. Not an endgame weapon, but one you can certainly whip out when sidearm challenges or bounties pop up. Pick barrel and mag perks that offset the weapon's poor handling and reload speed.

// Multimach CCX
dimwishlist:item=3717177717&perks=6634951542450788523#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. One of only a handful of SMGs that can still roll with scopes, and you've snagged the best one. The Model 8 RED bumps your zoom up from 13 to 17, and whilst that doesn't sound like a lot, this scope alone pushes your effective range out by 8 whole metres. Killing Wind pushes that out even further when you secure a kill, although your final perk does leave a little to be desired. Still, this'll do work. Pick whichever mag perk pushes out your range the most, and failing that, go for stability or reload speed. [Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling]
dimwishlist:item=3717177717&perks=2450788523,4049631843#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. New Recluse? You may well have it in your hands here. Just tag three opponents, finish one of them, and let the spree commence.

// Occluded Finality
dimwishlist:item=852551895&perks=3300816228,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst there are better PvE snipers available, this will do in a cinch for a 'whip it out and do some DPS' option.

dimwishlist:item=852551895&perks=3513791699,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP oddball pick. Remember Revoker? Want a weapon that's nearly the same, but slightly less consistent on the ammo return? This is your guy. Combine opening shot with the digustingly high zoom and you have a weapon that basically aims for you, and refunds ammo if you miss, it's wild.

// Seventh Seraph Carbine
dimwishlist:item=1561006927&perks=1354429876,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: This perk combo on this weapon is excellent.

This roll will not perform well in high difficulty content, but is a fun, slightly goofy roll for lower difficult stuff. Ambitious Assassin and Multikill Clip feed into eachother beautiful.

Whilst Multi-Kill Clip isn't the greatest for the very highest difficulties, given that you'll be spending entire magazines without securing a kill, this'll be very servicable in anything up to and including normal-mode raids. Pick magazine and barrel perks that enhance your mag size, stability and handling. [Recommended MW: Stability, Handling or Reload]

That and Timed Payload combines very well with anti-champion mods, making it an outstanding weapon for high-end PvE content. Fourth Times the Charm keeps magazine topped up as you'r'e firing. Select magazine and barrel perks that enhance your magazine size, stability and handling. You don't need range bumps for this weapon. [Recommended MW: Handling, Reload or Stability]

That said, it can roll perks that Shadow Price cannot, including Multi-Kill Clip which you have here. Killing Wind is the best of a bad bunch, and any combination of barrel and mag perks will work here. [Recommended MW: Any]

// The Vision
dimwishlist:item=2414141462&perks=2450788523,1015611457,#notes:Rostopher: Generalist pick. These burst sidearms are excellent in both PvE and PvP, with an extraordinary damage output within their range. Killing Wind will push that range out even further, and Kill Clip pushes your PvP TTK down to a ludicrous 0.43 seconds, and ramping up your damage in PvE. Even without min/maxing the barrel and sights, this will be a monster. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Archon's Thunder
dimwishlist:item=1967303408&perks=3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: Rampage is literally the only useful perk on column 4 of this weapon, and since you have it, this is probably worth keeping despite its other perks. Try to get stability, magazine size and reload speed from the magazine and barrel perks.

// Bequest
dimwishlist:item=3366545721&perks=2726471870,#notes:Rostopher: PvE oddball pick. Thresh is good on swords, and this is one of only a handful that can roll it. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Blast Battue
dimwishlist:item=2453357042&perks=2396489472,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Chain reaction on this weapon is possibly the only thing that makes it stand out.

dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=4104185692,#notes:Rostopher: Frenzy is terrific on SMGs, and given the wild perk pool on this weapon, even though the other perks aren't perfect, this might be worth keeping.

dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=3038247973,#notes:Rostopher: Given the absolutely wild perk pools on this weapon, the fact that you have one with Explosive Payload is pretty good - it's an excellent perk on hand cannons in both PvE and PvP. The other perks might not be great, but this perk carries the weapon a fair way on its own. Try to combo with barrel perks that enhance your stability and handling, and magazine perks that enhance your magazine size or range.

// Code Duello
dimwishlist:item=2496242052&perks=3927722942#notes:Rostopher: PvE DPS pick. As long as you can make sure you're not missing (as this weapon lacks tracking), this offers some of the best sustained DPS of any heavy weapon. Particularly potent when combined with hotswapping, and even more so if someone is running Divinity.  Lasting Impression does a lot of work to make this weapon servicable, so even without the perfect perks in the other slots, this will do work. [Recommended MW: Velocity]

// Cold Front
dimwishlist:item=1506719573&perks=4049631843#notes:Rostopher: Given the rarity of this weapon, if you managed to get one with One for All, consider yourself lucky. Pick barrel and mag perks that enhance either your magazine size, or stablity and range.
dimwishlist:item=1506719573&perks=3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Given the rarity of this weapon, getting on with Rampage on it is a blessing in disguise. Hold on to it, and look for barrel and mag perks that enhance either your magazine size, or stability and range.

// Commemoration
dimwishlist:item=4230965989&perks=1523832109,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Reconstruction turns this weapon from 'another machine gun' into something special. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Corrective Measure
dimwishlist:item=471518543&perks=2213355989,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Given that you are guaranteed to get less than half the magazine on heavy ammo pickup, you've got here a very dangerous weapon in PvP with just High Impact Reserves alone. Try to pick whatever barrel and mag perks you have that enhance stability or range, and make do with pretty much whatever you have in column 3.

// Crimil's Dagger
dimwishlist:item=4292849692&perks=1015611457,#notes:Rostopher: Following the nerf to 120 precision damage, this is one of the only remaining 120s that can roll with Kill Clip, and can therefore still two-tap with its damage perk active. Whilst the weapon itself is not as good as other 120s - featuring poorer numbers on nearly every stat including magazine size - this does give it some merit.

// Crowd Pleaser
dimwishlist:item=3565520715&perks=2396489472,#notes:Rostopher: Given the absolutely wild perk pool of this weapon, getting Chain Reaction on this weapon is low-key cool, so you might want to hold onto this until you get a more specialised roll.

// Crown-Splitter
dimwishlist:item=2782325302&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: You did it! You got the best perk in column 4 on this weapon! The other perks might not be the best, but Vorpal makes this weapon absolutely slap without additional help.

// Dead Man's Tale
dimwishlist:item=3654674561&perks=1354429876,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick - Fourth Time's synergises perfectly with Dead Man's exotic perk, letting you fire a total of 22 rounds before needing to reload, as long as you're nailing all precision hits. Whilst this perk on this own makes this weapon exceptional, there is a better specific roll available if you care to keep grinding. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3654674561&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: PvP/Generalist roll. Vorpal  is exceptional on this weapon, turning it into a Super-melting machine in PvP, and performing really well in PvE, particularly in higher-end content when Scout Rifles are in the Champion meta. Just Vorpal makes this weapon stand out, regardless of the rest of your perks, but a better roll is available if you care to keep grinding. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Deafening Whisper
dimwishlist:item=981718087&perks=3300816228,#notes:Rostopher: Auto-Loading Holster on this weapon is great, and the weapon is strong enough despite its weird perk pool that this will carry it almost entirely. [Recommended MW: Any]

dimwishlist:item=2807687156&perks=1771339417,#notes:Rostopher: This weapon exists in a nether where it serves no purpose, given that the Ikelos Sniper exists. However, it is one of only a handful of weapons that can roll Firing Line, so is worth a look for that. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Dream Breaker
dimwishlist:item=2931957300&perks=4104185692#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Dream Breaker is the only Fusion that can currently roll Frenzy, which is just a fantastic perk on anything it rolls on, being a combined reload and damage perk. This opens up your Column 3 for a utility perk instead of a reload perk, which Dream Breaker does have a wide selection of, so have a read of what your Column 3 does, and see what you can do with it. Pick barrel and battery perks that enhance your stability, handling and magazine size, in that order.

// Empty Vessel
dimwishlist:item=4255586669&perks=960810156,#notes:Rostopher: Given the expansive perk pool on this weapon, the fact that you've snagged one with Danger Zone is at the very least interesting. One of only a few breech GLs that can roll it, this buff to blast radius is not to be sniffed at.
dimwishlist:item=4255586669&perks=3523296417,#notes:Rostopher: Given the expansive perk pool on this weapon, the fact that you've snagged one with Demolitionist is pretty good. Demolitionist pairs really well with breech grenade launchers, allowing you to fire, throw your grenade, then fire again, whilst kills with it will recharge your grenade, so it effectively feeds off itself. Worth keeping until you snag a better one.
dimwishlist:item=4255586669&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: Given the expansive perk pool on this weapon, the fact that you've snagged one with Vorpal Weapon is a minor miracle. The other perks might not be the best, but it's unique in being one of only 2 special GLs that can roll it, so might be worth hanging on to until you get a better one.

// Escape Velocity
dimwishlist:item=1786797708&perks=3643424744,#notes:Rostopher: Overflow is great on 900 RPM SMGs, and whilst better rolls are very much available of this weapon, the perk alone will carry it a long way. Pick the mag and scopes that best buff the stats to your liking, and be on the look out for a roll with Overflow/Vorpal. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1786797708&perks=1546637391#notes:Rostopher: God-tier roll of this weapon for general use. 900 SMGs tend to cook adds fairly quickly without a damage perk, and Vorpal will buff your efficacy against yellow bars something fierce. Pick the scope and mag perks that provides the best bonuses - ideally buffing magazine size and stability, and make do with your column 3 perk until you find one with Overflow. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Eternal Blazon
dimwishlist:item=3514096004&perks=3643424744,#notes:Rostopher: This weapon is fairly unique among scouts, in that it can have Overflow on it! Seeing as you've got this one, keep it for now, but be on the look out for more potentially useful rolls.
dimwishlist:item=3514096004&perks=1683379515#notes:Rostopher: S-tier PvE shield-cracker, this - particularly in combination with Anti-Barrier Scout Rifle should it be on the artefact. Disruption Break renders targets vulnerable to kinetic damage, which benefits both you and your team, which makes it a great nightfall weapon. Pick the scope you hate the least, and be on the look out for a similar roll with Armor-Piercing Rounds and Overflow. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Exile's Curse
dimwishlist:item=679281855&perks=1754714824,#notes:Rostopher: Kickstart is fairly unique - only able to roll on a handful of fusions, and is an enormous amount of fun to use. Whilst the rest of the perks here aren't fully optimal, you may find some fun with this weapon in both PvE and PvP.

// Exile's Curse (Adept)
dimwishlist:item=276080079&perks=1754714824,#notes:Rostopher: Kickstart is fairly unique - only able to roll on a handful of fusions, and is an enormous amount of fun to use. Whilst the rest of the perks here aren't fully optimal, you may find some fun with this weapon in both PvE and PvP.

// Frozen Orbit
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=2551157718,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Given the wild perk pool on this weapon, you sometimes have to take what you're given, and Box Breathing is a nice consolation prize if you couldn't get Vorpal [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=957782887,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Given the wild perk pool on this weapon, you sometimes have to take what you're given, and Snapshot negates a lot of the downsizes of running an Aggressive Frame sniper. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Given the wild perk pool on this weapon, you sometimes have to take what you're given, and this is one of only a small number of snipers that can roll Vorpal, so this is worth keeping. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Grenade Launcher
dimwishlist:item=153950757&perks=3301904089,3032599245,3300816228,#notes:Rostopher: Having both spike and blinding grenades on a breech grenade launcher is one of the best possible combinations, giving you the choice between a utility weapon and a DPS machine. Auto-Loading Holster in combination with those two? Absolutely, 100% keep this weapon, even if your unmarked perk is a bit shit. The barrel perks barely matter, but try to snag Quick Launch if you have it, or one that increases velocity or handling.
dimwishlist:item=153950757&perks=3301904089,3032599245,2869569095,#notes:Rostopher: Having both spike and blinding grenades on a breech grenade launcher is one of the best possible combinations, giving you the choice between a utility weapon and a DPS machine. Field Prep, whilst not quite as useful as Auto-Loading Holster, is still excellent, allowing you to crouch to get a maxed-out reload speed. The barrel perks barely matter, but try to snag one that increases velocity or handling. You'll need to just make do with whatever your unmarked perks are until you find a better roll.

// Hawkmoon
dimwishlist:item=3856705927&perks=2846385770#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Rangefinder on Hawkmoon turns it into an insanely sticky hand cannon in crucible. You'll land shots you absolutely do not expect to - just don't get to used to the work it's doing for you! The barrel and grip perks could be better, but in truth, this will perform perfectly thanks to Hawkmoon's ridiculous base stats.
dimwishlist:item=3856705927&perks=2450788523#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Hawkmoon's random perks don't have much in the way of amazing PvE perks, but Killing Wind is probably the closest. The barrel and grip perks could be better, but in truth, this will perform perfectly thanks to Hawkmoon's ridiculous base stats.

// Heretic
dimwishlist:item=3067821200&perks=3927722942#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Lasting Impression is both hilarious AND powerful, a rare combination, bumping up your damage - albeit on a small delay - and increasing the size of the blast radius. Direct hit bosses, or shoot it on the floor in front of an onrushing wave of adds, it's up to you. Better perk options are available in column 3, but this is worth holding on to until you have a better roll. A lot of people will tell you that Impact Casing is essential, but in real terms, it's only increasing your damage output by ~2%. If you have it, use it, but otherwise just pick whichever launcher and mag perks enhance velocity and blast radius. [Recommended MW: Reload]

// Hezen Vengeance
dimwishlist:item=4050645223&perks=3643424744#notes:Rostopher: Hezen Vengeance is unique among rockets in its ability to roll Overflow, and whilst there are better rolls available with the perk, this is worth holding on to until you get one.

// High Albedo
dimwishlist:item=1197486957&perks=2450788523#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Burst sidearms are hugely underrated in PvP, with a ludicrously low BODY SHOT TTK that puts most other weapons to shame. In particular, this one's ability to roll Killing Wind makes it incredibly dangerous. Almost any perk in Column 4 will work well in Crucible, so keep what you have. It'll also be no slouch in PvE, making this a great generalist roll. Pick barrel and magazine perks that enhance its stability and range. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Hollow Words
dimwishlist:item=607191995&perks=1546637391#notes:Rostopher: Generalist pick. Whilst Hollow Words is not quite as good as the similar Plug One, it does have some small advantages over the nightfall weapon, such as its ability to roll Vorpal Weapon, which hey look! You got! Whilst better specific rolls are available, you may wish to hold on to this one for now until you secure one. [Recommended MW: Any except Charge Time]

// Ignition Code
dimwishlist:item=304659313&perks=3161816588#notes:Rostopher: Ignition Code is unique among breech GLs in its ability to roll Slideshot, allowing you to slide to reload instead of going through the lengthy reload animation. Whilst the other perks here aren't wildly brilliant, this will be fun to hang on to untill you find a better roll.

// Lonesome
dimwishlist:item=2199171672&perks=4267945040#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Full Auto Trigger System is the best perk for this weapon in Column 3 for PvE, and there's very few bad choices in Column 4. Whilst better specific rolls are available, this will work if you care to make use of it.

// Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver
dimwishlist:item=3037520408&perks=1954620775#notes:Rostopher: Whilst 180s aren't precisely optimal PvE weapons, this has the wonderful ability to spawn beautiful, shiny red nukes into the world, and that carries it a VERY long way. That and Timed Payload combines very well with anti-champion mods, making it an outstanding weapon for high-end PvE content, even with the less-than-optimal roll you have here. Make do with this until you secure a better one.
dimwishlist:item=3037520408&perks=1546637391#notes:Rostopher: Whilst 180s aren't precisely optimal PvE weapons, this has the wonderful ability to spawn beautiful, shiny red nukes into the world, and that carries it a VERY long way, particularly in higher end content where the bonus utility and damage from Warmind Cells will prove invaluable. Vorpal Weapon plays into that, giving you bonus damage against yellow-bar combatants, so it's good even with the less-than-optimal roll you have here. Pick magazine and barrel perks that enhance your mag size, stability and handling.

// Seventh Seraph VY-7
dimwishlist:item=766323545&perks=1546637391#notes:Rostopher: Whilst the Ikelos SMG is the favoured child of the community, there's another arc SMG that can spawn tiny nukes in town. This here isn't an absolutely min/maxed roll, but with Vorpal Weapon, you'll be able to take chunks out of yellow-bar combatants with ease. Until you get a better roll, this'll do just fine. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Any
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=3824105627#notes:Rostopher: Firefly alone on any weapon is really good, given it has both a damage effect and a reload speed buff on precision kills, and also means that the weapon can spawn warmind cells if you can secure kills with the Firefly explosion, thanks to the Wrath of Rasputin mod. Whilst better specific rolls will be available, this one is worth holding on to until you find them.
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=1631667848,4082225868,#notes:Rostopher: PvE oddball pick. Grave Robber and Swashbuckler in combination are a beautifully synergistic combo, and will work on pretty much any weapon, albeit only in activities where there is the potential to punch one guy, then unleash on the next. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=3643424744,4104185692#notes:Rostopher: Overflow combined with any damage perk that doesn't require you to reload is just terrific, as if you're smart, you can keep the uptime for the damage perk insanely high. You want to try to get magazine perks that enhance your magazine capacity (Appended, Extended and Tactical all work great), and pretty much any barrel perks. [Recommended MW: Any]

dimwishlist:item=2171478765&perks=3038247973,3824105627,#notes:Rostopher: Explosive/Firefly is the OG Destiny 1 roll of this weapon, and still holds up very well in Destiny 2's sandbox, particularly with the improvements made to Firefly. Whilst it's not incredible in high level endgame content, it'll be a great workhorse hand cannon in low and mid-tier activities.

Worth keeping, regardless of the other perks.

// Hand Cannon
dimwishlist:item=6&perks=2779035018,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: Reload speed perk + reload activated damage perk = profit. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Shotgun
dimwishlist:item=11&perks=1047830412,3142289711,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. In terms of shotguns, Full Choke combined with Accurized will largely be responsible for how consistently you can secure kills outside of 5 meters. Better rolls may be available that further enhance your capabilities in PvP, but as a base, this guy will do work in Crucible.
dimwishlist:item=11&perks=3300816228,2360754333#notes:Rostopher: Shotguns with Auto-Loading and Trench are, generally, quite good in PvE. Pull it out, punch a guy, then pump out three big-damage shots. Holster it and go back to your day. You want magazine perks that enhance magazine size; or Assault Mag for faster damage output. The only barrel perk you want to avoid with this roll is Full Choke, which reduces precision damage. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Sword
dimwishlist:item=54&perks=1749209109,3913600130#notes:Rostopher: Any sword with Relentless and Whirlwind is worth keeping. Landing light attacks ramps up your damage, and returns ammo, what's not to love? [Recommended MW: Impact]

// Age-Old Bond
dimwishlist:item=-601592879&perks=#notes:Rostopher: This is sadly just not a great weapon without very specific rolls, and your roll is not one of them. If it's your only one, might as well keep it - otherwise, it's time to run more Last Wishes and do Riven legit, yes?

// Any
dimwishlist:item=-69420&perks=3643424744,1015611457,#notes:Rostopher: Overflow and Kill Clip synergise extremely poorly, as you cannot reload if the magazine is overflowed, preventing you from proccing it. Bin this, and be on the look out for a better one.

// Apostate
dimwishlist:item=-2164448701&perks=#notes:Rostopher: The Apostate low-key sucks booty, with mediocre base stats, a bizarre recoil direction and a deeply uninteresting perk pool. I have never once said to myself 'boy I wish I had a rapid-fire arc sniper that looks like something out of Mad Max and only has perks that are useful if I secure kills with it'. There are a couple of decent rolls, but this is not one of them, and honestly, you're better off running almost anything else in its place.

// Archon's Thunder
dimwishlist:item=-1967303408&perks=#notes:Rostopher: A pretty big disappointment, this one. 360 machine guns really aren't good enough to justify using over 450 or even 900s (which are also bad FYI). There are a couple of specialised rolls that elevate it from the trash tier, but this is not one of them, so go hand in more Iron Banner tokies.

// Bottom Dollar
dimwishlist:item=-1046651176&perks=1820235745,#notes:Rostopher: Subsistence feels extremely poor on 120s without Extended Mag. Unless this is your only one, you'll probably want to bin this.

// Chroma Rush
dimwishlist:item=-1119734784&perks=1820235745,#notes:Rostopher: Subsistence only really works on this weapon when paired with Rampage - otherwise, it just takes so many bullets to get it going that you're not really making the most of the perk.

// Coriolis Force
dimwishlist:item=-3512349612&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Coriolis Force is a tough weapon to love. It recoils naturally almost horizontally to the left (in contrast to most fusions, which recoil slightly to the right and vertically), and is functionally useless in PvP. There are some niche rolls available on it that fit into some very specific builds as a void fusion rifle, but this is not one of those rolls, so only keep if you're doing so for completionist purposes.

// Corsair's Wrath
dimwishlist:item=-2714022207&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Whilst they did receive a buff, Linear Fusions are nowhere near as strong for DPS as rockets, grenade launchers or swords, and Corsair's Wrath has very little going for it to make it shine in its perk pool in PvE. There are some rolls out there that will do work in both PvE and PvP, but this is not one of them. Get it in the bin.

// Crimil's Dagger
dimwishlist:item=-4292849692&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Crimil's Dagger does feature some excellent rolls - however, this is not one of them, and the weapon is not nearly strong enough to use without a good roll, given it's deeply inferior stats to nearly every other 120 hand cannon.

// Death Adder
dimwishlist:item=-2742490609&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Death Adder was supposed to be the chosen one! It was supposed to replace The Recluse, not be left in Darkness! But in all seriousness, god this weapon is just disappointing as hell, with a poor selection of perks. It's only redeeming quality is it's one of only two solar SMGs in the game, so if you need to keep one on that basis, do so. There are also some rolls out there that do work, but this is not one of them, get it in the bin.

// Dream Breaker
dimwishlist:item=-2931957300&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Dream Breaker is inferior in every way to Trinary System. It's only redeeming qualities are that it can roll Kickstart and Frenzy, neither of which you have here, so you can safely bin this.

// Eternity's Edge
dimwishlist:item=-2782325301&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Whilst it was lovely that they reintroduced the class-specific swords, Eternity's Edge is certainly the most disappointing. With a bewilderingly small perk pool that lacks particular staples that ramp up swords' damage, the only benefit it really has is that it is a Solar Vortex Frame, and it has the unique perk of Infinite Guard, which would honestly be more helpful for a Titan than a warlock. Even then, you'll probably want to run Sola's Scar, Negative Space or Abide the Return for their more diverse and useful perk pools. There are exactly three good roll of this weapon, and this is not one of them, so bin this until you get it.

// Exile's Curse
dimwishlist:item=-679281855&perks=1264398905,#notes:Rostopher: So, you got Celerity. Guess it's time to get 3 legendary shard.

// Far Future
dimwishlist:item=-893527433&perks=#notes:Rostopher: This weapon has been largely superceded by the wildly superior Uzume RR4, which has a better perk package and can also roll as an Adept weapon. The only thing this really has going for it is its excellent aesthetic and its slightly lower zoom. There are some good rolls available on this weapon, but this is not one of them, so it can be safely punted into the bin. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Fatebringer
dimwishlist:item=-2171478765&perks=3038247973,1015611457,#notes:Rostopher: On paper, Explosive/Kill Clip should slap in both PvE and PvP. In practice, due to peculiarities with the way Explosive Payload functions, Kill Clip does not buff the damage of the explosive part of the round. As such, this combination is not as good as you think it is, and is probably best sharded.

// Finite Impactor
dimwishlist:item=-3813153080&perks=#notes:Rostopher: For whatever reason, Bungie have decreed that all arc 140 hand cannons must be kinda terrible, with the only notable exception to this rule being Nation of Beasts from Last Wish. This weapon is, indeed, not an exception, and whilst there are a couple of interesting rolls available, this is not one of them, so you can safely punt it into the trash.

// Found Verdict
dimwishlist:item=-3197270240&perks=1087426260#notes:Rostopher: Appended Mag absolutely ruins this weapon, as it has the same effect on the magazine size as Tactical Mag, but with none of the upsides. Unless this is your only copy of the weapon, shard it and look for a better one.
dimwishlist:item=-3197270240&perks=2420895100#notes:Rostopher: Extended mag absolutely ruins this weapon, as it has the same effect on the magazine size as Tactical Mag, but with a huge debuff to reload speed. Unless this is your only copy of the weapon, shard it and look for a better one.

// Hailing Confusion
dimwishlist:item=-2870169846&perks=839105230,1885400500,2387244414,4267945040#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst it lacks a damage perk, this is one of the most consistent neutral game pulses in the game. Zen Moment makes it a laser beam as you deal damage, and Full Auto keeps you firing at the optimal rate. Hold on to this one, as it's one of the few good rolls on this weapon.
dimwishlist:item=-2870169846&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Hailing Confusion is, overall, a dissapointing weapon, with a clunky scope, a poor recoil score and an underwhelming perk selection. There are a couple of specific rolls that are interesting available, but this is not one of them, so you can safely bin this.

// Heretic
dimwishlist:item=-3067821200&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Heretic is a weird one. It can roll Lasting Impression, and is unique among arc rockets in this regard, but is otherwise unimpressive compared to Subzero Salve, Shining Sphere and Sleepless, which feature more interesting perk packages. Sadly, you do not have Lasting Impression, so if you can be bothered to farm out another one, it's worth a shot. But you can safely bin this one.

// Honor's Edge
dimwishlist:item=-2857348871&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Honor's Edge is a deeply uninteresting weapon, with a dissapointing perk selection that doesn't really give it utility over other arc swords like Temptations Hook and Bequest. Completionists may wish to keep a copy, but otherwise you can safely shard this, you're not missing out. Plus, y'know, fuck New Monarchy, fucking Space Fascists the lot of 'em.

// Hoosegow
dimwishlist:item=-3669616453&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Hoosegow is deeply inferior, in both available perks, utility and base stats to Sleepless, Shining Sphere and Subzero Salvo. There are a couple of very specific rolls that'll do work, but this is not one of them, so you can safely shard it.

// Horror Story
dimwishlist:item=-3829285960&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Horror Story has almost nothing going for it when randomly rolled, with a poor selection of perks, and base stats that are easily outclassed by the Braytech Werewolf, which came from the same event. If you want to use this weapon, pull the curated roll from your collection.

// Orewing's Maul
dimwishlist:item=-2108920981&perks=#notes:Rostopher: A poor man's Truthteller. Whilst there are some entirely servicable rolls of this weapon, this is not one of them, and it's not only easier, but better to hunt down a good Truthteller, which has a wildly superior perk pool.

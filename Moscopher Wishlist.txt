title:The Moscopher Wishlist
description:This is a compiled list of recommended and god rolls from The Guardian Grill's most annoying stat-whores.

// Accrued Redemption
dimwishlist:item=4095896073&perks=852209214,3827198035,201365942,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: This is the discerning bow-users roll. Buffs to accuracy from the string and arrow perks, alongside the classic Archer's Tempo/Rampage combo. This bow is rare as hell, and this is a perfect roll on it, so whack a rampage spec on it, and keep it. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Age-Old Bond
dimwishlist:item=601592879&perks=1467527085,679225683,1354429876,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Whilst 360 autos aren't exactly optimal weapons, this curated roll works just fine. It's got a ton of range, so can be useful for cracking void shields at range, and pairs really nicely with Anti-Barrier Auto Rifle when it's on the artefact. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Ancient Gospel
dimwishlist:item=48643186&perks=4090651448,106909392,1168162263,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Ancient Gospel is a great little handcannon that'll do work wherever hand cannons are good. This roll is fully min/maxed to do work for you, with Outlaw and Kill Clip providing a lovely synergistic pairing, and Tactical Mag bumping up your magazine size and reducing your reload speed, to minimise your downtime. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=48643186&perks=1482024992,3142289711,699525795,2846385770#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 140s are almost always a competetive pick, particularly if you have the aim to let them sing, and this roll will do work for you at plenty of ranges. Eye of the Storm is an underrated perk for PvP, increasing your bullet magnetism as your health gets lower, which might give you the edge you need in a duel. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Apex Predator
dimwishlist:item=2545083870&perks=3525010810,3796465595,3977735242,3300816228#notes:Rostopher: Apex Predator is the runt of the rocket launcher family. It's perk selection is microscopic, its curated roll is weird at the best of times and it has largely been superceded by Code Duello. However, if you do have this particular roll, this is probably the absolute min-maxed DPS roll you can get, so hold onto it. [Recommended MW: Velocity]

// Apostate
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=839105230,106909392,1556840489,3038247973#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick for this otherwise mediocre weapon. Arrowhead sorts out the vaguely bizarre recoil direction, with Tac Mag bumping up your stablity, reload speed and mag size to acceptable ranges. Lead from Gold will keep you stocked up, and Explosive Payload is the only perk that increases damage per shot, rather than per kill. Half-decent, but Adored or Occluded Finality have much better PvE rolls available. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=4090651448,3142289711,2866798147,47981717#notes:Rostopher: If you're mad enough to want to use this weapon in PvP, this is probably the best roll you can find. Bear in mind that you'll need, count 'em, THREE body shots to kill a guardian if you miss the headshot, so make sure you're landing those headshots, and with this roll, it's just a little bit more forgiving to do so. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=1840239774,3142289711,2866798147,47981717#notes:Rostopher: If you're mad enough to want to use this weapon in PvP, this is probably the best roll you can find. Bear in mind that you'll need, count 'em, THREE body shots to kill a guardian if you miss the headshot, so make sure you're landing those headshots, and with this roll, it's just a little bit more forgiving to do so. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Arctic Haze
dimwishlist:item=20935540&perks=4090651448,106909392,2450788523,2848615171#notes:Rostopher: Generalist PvE pick. Corkscrew Rifling is the best all-rounder barrell option, buffing stablity, handling and range all at once; Tac Mag bumps your magazine size, stablity and reload speed. Killing Wind/Dragonfly is a great perk combo for low-end content, keeping you mobile and exploding big crowds of enemies. [Recommended MW: Reload]
dimwishlist:item=20935540&perks=4090651448,106909392,3400784728,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: Min/Maxed PvE pick. Corkscrew Rifling is the best all-rounder barrell option, buffing stablity, handling and range all at once; Tac Mag bumps your magazine size, stablity and reload speed; and Triple Tap/Vorpal will see you burning down Yellow Bars and bosses in a beautifully efficient champion. Particularly good with Anti-Barrier Auto Rifle, but will do work without it as well. [Recommended MW: Reload]
dimwishlist:item=20935540&perks=3250034553,3142289711,2450788523,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Maximised range, with Killing Wind pushing it out even further upon kill and keeping you moving, and Vorpal Weapon allowing you to burn down supers surprisingly quickly. Don't sleep on this weapon. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Arsenic Bite-4b
dimwishlist:item=720351795&perks=852209214,3429800428,3425386926,201365942#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. The OG energy bow, the combo of Archer's Tempo and Rampage is a thing of beauty. Fiberglass Arrows max out your accuracy, and Polymer String gets your draw time down as far as possible, maximising your damage potention. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Astral Horizon
dimwishlist:item=1697682876&perks=1300023272,791862061,3300816228,2360754333#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Not that you'll likely use this weapon in PvE, but if you do happen upon this roll, it does do a fair amount of work (for example, it can 1-tap Oracles in Vault of Glass). Auto-Loading holster pairs very nicely with Trench Barrell, Assault Mag ramps up your fire rate, and Barrel Shroud gives you the biggest possible bump to handling, making sure you can whip it out quickly. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Astral Horizon (Adept)
dimwishlist:item=532746994&perks=1300023272,791862061,3300816228,2360754333#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Not that you'll likely use this weapon in PvE, but if you do happen upon this roll, it does do a fair amount of work. Auto-Loading holster pairs very nicely with Trench Barrell, Assault Mag ramps up your fire rate, and Barrel Shroud gives you the biggest possible bump to handling, making sure you can whip it out quickly. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=532746994&perks=1332244541,3142289711,3436462433,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Maximised range, bonus accuracy on the first shot of your attack, and a bump to handling from Surplus. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Avalanche
dimwishlist:item=66875353&perks=1561002382,2450788523,1890422124#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Avalanche may look like a slightly mishapen potato, but as machine guns go, this thing will do work. Killing Wind will push your range out and give you the zoomies, tap the trigger keeps you honest with your recoil, and High-Cal rounds will flinch off even the most persistent of snipers. Scopes on this thing really come down to personal preference, so use whichever one you like best. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Bad Omens
dimwishlist:item=991314988&perks=1478423395,3796465595,3977735242,1275731761#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Bad Omens is a lovely rocket launcher that has, sadly been largely superceded by the superior Royal Entry. That said, this roll will be entirely functional at Blowing Shit Up™.  This is also the curated roll, so always worth hanging on to it. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Bequest
dimwishlist:item=3366545721&perks=3666208348,269888150,1749209109,354401740#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Holding the dubious honour of 'Perhaps most disappointing raid weapon', Bequest is a weapon that is very much style over substance. That said, Relentless Strikes and Assassin's Blade will be entirely functional in low-end content. Swordmaster's gets your heavy attack back faster, and Jagged Edge maximises your damage potential. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Berenger's Memory
dimwishlist:item=407621213&perks=3301904089,2869569095,3300816228,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Berenger's sits in an odd place, in that it's a rapid fire frame, so your mileage with it may vary. Spike/Auto-Loading/Field Prep, however, is a snappy PvE roll that'll work in almost any situation, with the extra reserves and fast reload on demand from Field Prep being particularly welcome. The barrel perk doesn't really make much of a difference, but try to maximise handling and blast radius. [Recommended MW: Blast Radius]
dimwishlist:item=407621213&perks=3301904089,2869569095,3523296417,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Berenger's sits in an odd place, in that it's a rapid fire frame, so your mileage with it may vary. Spike/Demolitionist/Field Prep, however, is a snappy PvE roll that'll work in almost any situation. Just remember, you can reload by yeeting a grenade - use this to your advantage. The barrel perk doesn't really make much of a difference, but try to maximise handling and blast radius. [Recommended MW: Blast Radius]
dimwishlist:item=407621213&perks=3301904089,706527188,3300816228,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Berenger's sits in an odd place, in that it's a rapid fire frame, so your mileage with it may vary. Spike/Auto-Loading/Quickdraw, however, is a snappy PvE roll that'll work in almost any situation. The barrel perk doesn't really make much of a difference, but try to maximise handling and blast radius. [Recommended MW: Blast Radius]

// Bite of the Fox
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=4090651448,3142289711,957782887,588594999#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat cotentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=4090651448,3142289711,957782887,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat cotentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=1840239774,1087426260,247725512,2869569095#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst you probably have better PvE snipers than this, this roll will work in a variety of situations. Just remember to crouch when you reload. [Recommended MW: Reload]
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=3250034553,3142289711,957782887,588594999#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat cotentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=3250034553,3142289711,957782887,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat cotentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Biting Winds
dimwishlist:item=1621657423&perks=852209214,3827198035,2450788523,3350417888#notes:Rostopher: Biting Winds is a bit of an odd duck in the bow department. It's the only bow that cannot roll with Archer's Tempo, and so we must look elsewhere for utility. Killing Wind is rather good on pretty much everything, and Sympathetic Arsenal was designed for bows, given that you are always 'reloading' it when you nock an arrow. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]
dimwishlist:item=1621657423&perks=852209214,3827198035,247725512,4082225868#notes:Rostopher: Biting Winds is a bit of an odd duck in the bow department. It's the only bow that cannot roll with Archer's Tempo, and Rapid Hit feels like a poor replacement. However, this roll still gets the jop done, and as a bonus, you can punch a guy for a big stack of damage boost. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Blasphemer
dimwishlist:item=2782847179&perks=3250034553,3142289711,706527188,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. The curated roll of this weapon is a monstrous contender in PvP. If you like slug shotguns therein, you'll like this one. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Borrowed Time
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=839105230,1968497646,3643424744,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE god tier pick. Arrowhead makes the weapon incredibly controllable, Armor-Piercing makes the weapon do even more damage to shields, and will clean-up waves of weaker adds in a jiffy. Overflow is terrific on almost anything it rolls on, and the classic Rampage to round out the package. If you got this, you're enormously  lucky! Lock it and keep it. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=4090651448,1885400500,2450788523,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvP god tier pick. More or less maxed range, stability also maxed out - this thing hits for maximum damage at 18 meters, and Killing Wind will push that out even further. One stack of rampage reduces your TTK by 1 shot down to 7c1b/0.6 seconds as well. If you snagged this and like PvP, absolutely keep it. It'll do work in PvE too! [Recommended MW: Range]

// Bottom Dollar
dimwishlist:item=-1046651176&perks=4090651448,2420895100,1820235745,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Subsistence combined with Extended Mag is the only way Subsistence really works on this weapon - ensuring you get 2 bullets back instead of 1, you can basically fire it forever in low-end content. Each stack of Rampage will make sure that you're definitely killing everything in front of you, so you may never need to reload ever. Do note that this weapon will likely perform poorly in higher tier content - it's a red-bar slayer and not much more.
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=4090651448,106909392,1168162263,2458213969#notes:Rostopher: God tier roll here. Corkscrew Rifling gives you a flat buff to 3 stats with no downsides; Tac Mag gives you an extra bullet and a bonus to reload and stability; and Outlaw/Multi-Kill Clip is a perfectly synergistic 3rd and 4th. This thing hits like a train in both PvE and PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=3250034553,3142289711,2450788523,47981717#notes:Rostopher: An insane max-range roll for PvP here. You're sacrificing a damage perk for Opening Shot, but if you can combine it with High Energy Fire or other damage buffs, this thing has insane two-tap range, and is outrageously consistent in duels. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Brass Attacks
dimwishlist:item=2121785039&perks=3661387068,1431678320,3643424744,3350417888#notes:Rostopher: Not so much good as unique, this is the Season Pass roll of this weapon from Season of the Chosen, and features Overflow, which cannot roll on the weapon otherwise. So worth keeping purely on that basis.
dimwishlist:item=2121785039&perks=4090651448,1885400500,2450788523,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Aggressive Burst sidearms are hugely underrated in PvP, and Brass Attacks with this roll absolutely slaps. Rampage lowers your already ridiculously low TTK, and Killing Wind lets you compete at nearly auto-rifle ranges. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// BrayTech Werewolf
dimwishlist:item=528834068&perks=3250034553,1968497646,2387244414,2458213969#notes:Rostopher: This is the curated roll of this weapon, and is extremely reliable in both PvE and PvP. Hold onto this if you managed to snag it. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=528834068&perks=1482024992,1885400500,1359896290,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: Oddball PvP pick. Vorpal Weapon is great in PvP, and this weapon will keep you on target for long enough to absolutely mince enemy supers. Combine with High Energy fire for maximum carnage. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Cartesian Coordinate
dimwishlist:item=2481881293&perks=2405638014,1687452232,2779035018,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Feeding Frenzy plays will with rapid-fire fusions in low-end content, and Vorpal will help you put in some half-decent DPS to yellow-bar enemies. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=2481881293&perks=2405638014,1687452232,1631667848,4082225868#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Grave Robber/Swash is always a fun combo, and given the relatively short range of this fusion, you'll almost always be within punching distance of something, so your uptime on Swash will be terrific. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=2481881293&perks=2405638014,1687452232,1866048759,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. If you are insane enough to use this in PvP, then this roll will do some work. Make sure to take advantage of hip-fire grip, so you can stay mobile without having to ADS, which should give you an edge particularly against supers. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Chattering Bone
dimwishlist:item=568515759&perks=4090651448,679225683,1015611457,2213355989#notes:Rostopher: This is the curated roll of this weapon, and it works very well in both PvP and PvP. Hold onto it if you got it. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=568515759&perks=4090651448,1885400500,1168162263,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst Lightweight Frames suffer in the DPS department compared to other pulse rifles, this roll covers a lot of the defecits that come with them. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Chroma Rush
dimwishlist:item=1119734784&perks=4090651448,3142289711,1359896290,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 720s are deeply underrated in PvP, with a not unimpressive .77 TTK. Corkscrew and Accurized will push your range out to 23 meters, and Dynamic Sway will keep the weapon from bouncing around too hard. Proccing Kill Clip will drop your TTK to .60 for the duration, so is not to be sniffed at. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1119734784&perks=4090651448,3142289711,2946784966,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 720s are deeply underrated in PvP, with a not unimpressive .77 TTK. Corkscrew and Accurized will push your range out to 23 meters. Kill Clip and Tunnel Vision are curiously synergistic, proccing on reloading after a kill, so you can just beam the next guy after securing a kill. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1119734784&perks=4090651448,106909392,2779035018,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Feeding Frenzy + Kill Clip is a lovely synergistic combo, giving you a huge bump to your already impressive DPS on this weapon. The flat buff to 3 stats from Corkscrew Rifling will keep the weapon under control, and Tactical Mag is always a great option on more or less any weapon. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1119734784&perks=1392496348,1431678320,1820235745,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Subsistence + Rampage is a quintessential add-clearing pick, and the massive magazine on this weapon means as long as your focusing on red-bars, you may never need to reload. Alloy Mag gives a lovely snappy reload if you do hit the bottom of the mag, and Polygonal's stability bump is a super welcome bump to the weapon's controllability. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=1119734784&perks=1392496348,106909392,1820235745,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Subsistence + Rampage is a quintessential add-clearing pick, and the massive magazine on this weapon means as long as your focusing on red-bars, you may never need to reload. Tac Mag maximises your magazine without penalising you if you did hit the bottom of the mag, and Polygonal's stability bump is a super welcome bump to the weapon's controllability. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Code Duello
dimwishlist:item=2496242052&perks=3525010810,3796465595,3300816228,3927722942#notes:Rostopher: PvE DPS pick. As long as you can make sure you're not missing (as this weapon lacks tracking), this offers some of the best sustained DPS of any heavy weapon. Particularly potent when combined with hotswapping, and even more so if someone is running Divinity. [Recommended MW: Velocity]

// Cold Denial
dimwishlist:item=1216130969&perks=839105230,3230963543,2779035018,2458213969#notes:Rostopher: Generalist pick. Whilst this weapon is cumbersome at the best of times, this set of perks is a great combo assuming you can get to grips with the poor handling and odd scope. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1216130969&perks=839105230,1561002382,2387244414,460017080#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Arrowhead break is almost essential on this weapon given its slightly squirly recoil direction. High-Cal pushes your range out and increases the already heft flinch that you'll be dishing out. Zen Moment will kick your reticule steady, and Headseeker will help you secure those two-burst kills. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=1216130969&perks=2779035018,2458213969#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. MKC and FF are a great pairing for obvious reasons, and ramping up the damage will allow you to cut through red bars with ease. Go for barrel perks that either straighten up your recoil (Arrowhead or Chambered), or increase stability and reload speed to try to offset this weapons weaknesses.

// Cold Front
dimwishlist:item=1506719573&perks=4090651448,106909392,1820235745,4049631843#notes:Rostopher: PvE S-tier roll. Tag up three enemies, then start shredding through them and you may never need to reload again. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1506719573&perks=4090651448,106909392,1820235745,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Rampage ramping up the damage will get the most out of Subsistence, with Tact Mag and Corkscrew Rifling providing flat buffs to almost all of the weapons stats. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1506719573&perks=4090651448,106909392,1820235745,4082225868#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Swashbuckler ramping up the damage will get the most out of Subsistence, with Tact Mag and Corkscrew Rifling providing flat buffs to almost all of the weapons stats.

// Commemoration
dimwishlist:item=4230965989&perks=839105230,3142289711,1359896290,588594999#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 450 machine guns are the go-to for PvP, and this roll makes sure you keep on target, keeping the recoil under control, pushing the range out to pretty close to maximum, and bumping your aim assist whilst moving. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=4230965989&perks=2420895100,1523832109,3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Reconstruction turns this weapon from 'another machine gun' into something special. Extended mag means you can have up to 146 bullets in a magazine, which is, y'know, insane. Rampage is the best of a bad bunch of machine guns in column 4, and the barrel perks don't really make much impact on how you'll use this weapon. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Coriolis Force
dimwishlist:item=3512349612&perks=839105230,1687452232,2779035018,4049631843#notes:Rostopher: One of the few half decent rolls on this weapon. Arrowhead brings the recoil more in line with a traditional fusion rifle, and Liquid Coils gives you the most bang for your buck.

Steadyhand goes a long way to offsetting the weapon's inherently poor handling and stability stats, with Accurized and Rangefinder doing the bulk of the work in the range department.

Vorpal is exceptional on this weapon, turning it into a Super-melting machine in PvP, and performing really well in PvE, particularly in higher-end content when Scout Rifles are in the Champion meta.

Corkscrew Rifling does a nice flat buff to handling, stability and range, Light Mag keeps the reload snappy and pushes out your range; and Tunnel Vision locks your high-damage shots from Multi-Kill Clip onto the heads of your enemies.

Quickdraw means you can get it out fast in a tight spot, and Rangefinder more or less makes the weapon hit the range cap for 140s when aiming down sights.

These burst side arms are absolutely monstrous in PvE, and with One for All, as long as you're comfortable proccing it, it ramps the damage up by 35%.

This roll will feel SUPER snappy, and will hit close to 140's range cap when ADS thanks to rangefinder. Ricochet for the cheeky range and stablity buff, and steadyhand to keep the stability in check.  [Recommended MW: Range]

// Distant Tumulus
dimwishlist:item=2807687156&perks=2848615171,1771339417,#notes:Rostopher: This weapon exists in a nether where it serves no purpose, given that the Ikelos Sniper exists. However, it is one of only a handful of weapons that can roll Firing Line, and uniquely has Dragonfly in Column 3, so can combine with Firing Line for dual utility, so is worth a look for that. [Recommended MW: Any]

// The Vision
dimwishlist:item=2414141462&perks=2450788523,1015611457,#notes:Rostopher: Generalist pick. These burst sidearms are excellent in both PvE and PvP, with an extraordinary damage output within their range. Killing Wind will push that range out even further, and Kill Clip pushes your PvP TTK down to a ludicrous 0.43 seconds, and ramping up your damage in PvE. Even without min/maxing the barrel and sights, this will be a monster. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Accrued Redemption
dimwishlist:item=4095896073&perks=201365942,3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: The classic bow roll. If you like bows, this'll do it for you - it's a beautiful-feeling bow that is rare as hell, so if you have this, keep it. Pretty much any string and arrow perks will work. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Archon's Thunder
dimwishlist:item=1967303408&perks=839105230,106909392,3513791699,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: This here is the best roll available on this weapon. Arrowhead Brake sorts out its weird recoil pattern, Tactical Mag buffs the magazine size, reload speed and stability, and Mulligan/Rampage is a pretty tasty combo for those of us who like to shoot but sometimes miss things. [Recommended MW: Reload]

// Ancient Gospel
dimwishlist:item=48643186&perks=1168162263,1015611457,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Ancient Gospel is a great little handcannon that'll do work wherever hand cannons are good. Outlaw/Kill Clip is a classic synergistic pairing that'll minimise your downtime and maximise your damage output. [Recommended MW: Any]

Rapid Hit/Kill Clip is a great pairing on Hand Cannons, with the former not only increasing your reload speed, but also ramping up your stability as your hit more precision shots. Reload for a tasty damage buff. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Apex Predator
dimwishlist:item=2545083870&perks=2010801679,1015611457,#notes:Rostopher: Apex Predator is the runt of the rocket launcher family. It's perk selection is microscopic, its curated roll is weird at the best of times and it has largely been superceded by Code Duello. This roll is more interesting than practical, with Kill Clip and Ambitious Assassin being curiously synergistic. Fire, kill some dudes, reload, get 2 mega-charged rockets. Rinse and repeat as necessary. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=2545083870&perks=3977735242,3300816228,#notes:Rostopher: Apex Predator is the runt of the rocket launcher family. It's perk selection is microscopic, its curated roll is weird at the best of times and it has largely been superceded by Code Duello. Still, auto-loading/tracking is a solid pick for any rocket launcher, and will work great on this one. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Apostate
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=2866798147,47981717,#notes:Rostopher: If you're mad enough to want to use this weapon in PvP, this is probably the best 3rd and 4th perk combo for it. Bear in mind that you'll need, count 'em, THREE body shots to kill a guardian if you miss the headshot, so make sure you're landing those headshots, and with this roll, it's just a little bit more forgiving to do so.

// Arctic Haze
dimwishlist:item=20935540&perks=1820235745,2848615171,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Arctic Haze is sorely underrated, and that's largely down to it's lack of damage-boosting perk. However, this roll is a bit of a treat, with Dragonfly kills proccing Subsistence, so for low-level content, this is an add-clearing machine. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=20935540&perks=3400784728,1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Arctic Haze is sorely underrated, and that's largely down to it's lack of damage-boosting perk. However, in mid-to-high end content (assuming Autos are in the champion meta), this roll will do work, with Triple Tap meaning you can fire for days on a stunned champ, and Vorpal boosting your damage on the target. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Arsenic Bite-4b
dimwishlist:item=720351795&perks=2848615171,201365942,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. The OG energy bow, the combo of Archer's Tempo and Dragonfly is a thing of beauty. Even without min-maxing the string and arrow perks, this'll do work for you. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Avalanche
dimwishlist:item=66875353&perks=3300816228,1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Avalanche may look like a slightly mishapen potato, but as machine guns go, this thing will do work. Fire until empty on the nearest yellow bar, holster it and let auto-loading do its work, rinse and repeat. The barrel and mag perks don't really make much of a difference, but look to increase your magazine size, and bump up your stablity as best you can. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Crown-Splitter
dimwishlist:item=2782325302&perks=3666208348,1749209109,3913600130#notes:Rostopher: What you have here is the second best roll of this weapon. Relentless + Whirlwind is an extremely reliable combination, and technical outperforms Vorpal weapon in the DPS stakes, albeit you have to consume 4 ammo to ramp it up to maximum. Jagged Edge keeps your damage output up, so swing away.

// Bequest
dimwishlist:item=3366545721&perks=2726471870,#notes:Rostopher: PvE oddball pick. Thresh is good on swords, and this is one of only a handful that can roll it. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Blasphemer
dimwishlist:item=2782847179&perks=791862061,1354429876,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Blasphemer is unique in that it can roll Fourth Time's the Charm, meaning you can fire it 10 times before you need to reload, which is great in a variety of stationary boss situations. [Recommended MW: Reload]

// Blast Battue
dimwishlist:item=2453357042&perks=2396489472,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Chain reaction on this weapon is possibly the only thing that makes it stand out. Otherwise, the odd placement of perks in the columns make it tough to love this weapon in PvE when Interference VI exists. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Borrowed Time
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=1359896290,3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick on this weapon. Dynamic Sway Reduction keeps you on target, and one stack of Rampage will put your TTK down to a blistering 0.6 seconds with all headshots.

dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=1631667848,4082225868,#notes:Rostopher: Grave Robber/Swash is a great little combo, and given the range that SMGs usually operate at, their ought to be something nearby to punch, which reloads your mag and gives you a huge damage buff.
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=2450788523,4104185692,#notes:Rostopher: Frenzy is a reload perk when it procs, so you can safely insert another utility perk into column 4, and Killing Wind is a terrific pick on SMGs.
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=2450788523,3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick on this weapon. Killing Wind bumps your range, movement speed and aim assist, and one stack of Rampage will put your TTK down to a blistering 0.6 seconds with all headshots.
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=3643424744,3523296417,#notes:Rostopher: Utility pick. When you just don't want to reload manually, why not reload with a grenade? Or by picking up special or heavy ammo?! The choice is yours with this roll.
dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=3643424744,4104185692,#notes:Rostopher: Overflow combined with a damage perk will be terrific on this weapon. You lucked out here, keep this and enjoy.

// Bottom Dollar
dimwishlist:item=-1046651176&perks=2420895100,1820235745,#notes:Rostopher: Subsistence combined with Extended Mag is the only way Subsistence really works on this weapon - ensuring you get 2 bullets back instead of 1, you can basically fire it forever in low-end content. Do note that the weapon will likely perform poorly in higher tier content.
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=2779035018,3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: Feeding Frenzy/Rampage is a classic combination on any weapon, and on Bottom Dollar, it's going to feel terrific. Try to combo it with a magazine perk that gives you more bullets, and barrel perks that add handling or range.
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=1168162263,3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: Outlaw Rampage is a classic combination on any weapon, and on Bottom Dollar, it's going to feel terrific. Try to combo it with a magazine perk that gives you more bullets, and barrel perks that add handling or range.

dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=2458213969#notes:Rostopher: Multi-Kill Clip is great on this weapon. Ideally you want something that enhances reload speed (Outlaw, Rapid Hit, Feeding Frenzy, Surplus). Avoid Subsistence, it feels awful. If you can get Tactical or Appended Magazine, that's great too. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Brass Attacks
dimwishlist:item=2121785039&perks=4090651448,1885400500,2450788523,4104185692#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Brass Attacks is a workhorse in PvE. With Frenzy, you don't really need a reload perk, as Frenzy IS a reload perk, so Killing Wind is the almost obvious replacement for Feeding Frenzy or Rapid Hit, pushing your range out ludicrously, and giving you the zoomies in the process. [Recommended MW: Stability]

dimwishlist:item=528834068&perks=1354429876,4082225868,#notes:Rostopher: If you don't have the curated roll of this weapon, this roll is a great alternative for PvE. FTTC is great on Autos, and Swashbuckler lets you get stuck into the fray for big damage buffs on melee kills. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Code Duello
dimwishlist:item=2496242052&perks=3796465595,3927722942,#notes:Rostopher: PvE DPS pick. As long as you can make sure you're not missing (as this weapon lacks tracking), this offers some of the best sustained DPS of any heavy weapon. Particularly potent when combined with hotswapping, and even more so if someone is running Divinity.  Lasting Impression with Impact Casing does a lot of work to make this weapon servicable, so even without the perfect perks in the other slots, this will do work. [Recommended MW: Velocity]

// Cold Front
dimwishlist:item=1506719573&perks=1820235745,4049631843#notes:Rostopher: PvE roll. Tag up three enemies, then start shredding through them and you may never need to reload again. Pick barrel and mag perks that enhance either your magazine size, or stablity and range. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1506719573&perks=1820235745,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Rampage ramping up the damage will get the most out of Subsistence. Pick barrel and mag perks that enhance either your magazine size, or stablity and range. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Commemoration
dimwishlist:item=4230965989&perks=1523832109,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Reconstruction turns this weapon from 'another machine gun' into something special. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Coriolis Force
dimwishlist:item=3512349612&perks=2779035018,4049631843,#notes:Rostopher: One of the few half decent rolls on this weapon. You're almost guaranteed to over-penetrate targets and proc One-for-All, so make sure you're going to town with it.

// Crowd Pleaser
dimwishlist:item=3565520715&perks=2284787283,2396489472,#notes:Rostopher: This is a nice little combo on this weapon - great for dealling with large waves of red-bar adds. Look for Spike, Proxy or Mini-Frags to maximise your murder potential. The barrel perk literally doesn’t matter. [Recommended MW: Velocity]
dimwishlist:item=3565520715&perks=2869569095,3523296417,#notes:Rostopher: This is a nice little combo on this weapon - great sustained DPS. If you have Spike Grenades, great!

// Dead Man's Tale
dimwishlist:item=3654674561&perks=1354429876,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick - Fourth Time's synergises perfectly with Dead Man's exotic perk, letting you fire a total of 22 rounds before needing to reload, as long as you're nailing all precision hits. Whilst this perk on this own makes this weapon exceptional, there is a better specific roll available if you care to keep grinding. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3654674561&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: PvP/Generalist roll. Vorpal  is exceptional on this weapon, turning it into a Super-melting machine in PvP, and performing really well in PvE, particularly in higher-end content when Scout Rifles are in the Champion meta. Just Vorpal makes this weapon stand out, regardless of the rest of your perks, but a better roll is available if you care to keep grinding. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Deafening Whisper
dimwishlist:item=981718087&perks=3300816228,#notes:Rostopher: Auto-Loading Holster on this weapon is great, and the weapon is strong enough despite its weird perk pool that this will carry it almost entirely. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Dire Promise
dimwishlist:item=2742838701&perks=1968497646,3400784728,1774574192,#notes:Rostopher: Oddball PvE pick. This roll will work well in situations where you maybe need an extra shield-cracking weapon. Armor-Piercing Rounds enhances its damage on shields, and Osmosis will let you turn it elemental with the throw of a grenade. The site doesn't really matter, but try to pick something that enhances stablity or handling. [Recommended MW: Reload]

// Distant Tumulus
dimwishlist:item=2807687156&perks=1771339417,#notes:Rostopher: This weapon exists in a nether where it serves no purpose, given that the Ikelos Sniper exists. However, it is one of only a handful of weapons that can roll Firing Line, so is worth a look for that. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Enigma's Draw
dimwishlist:item=1723380073&perks=4267945040,4082225868,#notes:Rostopher: Whilst 260 sidearms aren't exactly the bees knees, this is a pretty good combo of perks 3 and 4 for this weapon. Full Auto bypasses the slightly odd firing cadence, and Swash is great in low-level and raid-level content. Pair with Surprise Attack for maximum silliness.

// Fatebringer
dimwishlist:item=2171478765&perks=3038247973,3824105627,#notes:Rostopher: Explosive Payload and Firefly is the O.G. roll from Destiny 1, and it still holds up in D2's sandbox. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Friction Fire
dimwishlist:item=1513993763&perks=2450788523,3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: Friction Fire is largely outclassed by other kinetic SMGs (particularly Extraordinary Rendition), thanks to it's thunderous handling and slow reload speed, but Killing Wind/Rampage works very well on it, and is worth a sniff.

// Frozen Orbit
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=3300816228,706527188,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Auto-Loading/Quickdraw is a nice perk combo, particularly for moments were you need to do a quick burst of DPS. [Recommended MW: Any]

dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=588594999,47981717,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Assuming you are comfotable with hard-scoping, rather than needing to quickscope, this roll has ungodly levels of aim assistance on the first shot fired. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=588594999,957782887,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Snapshot sights and Moving Target will offset the slow ADS speed, and provide a little bump to Aim Assistance, allowing you to nail those quickscopes. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Gridskipper
dimwishlist:item=1621558458&perks=2946784966,2458213969,#notes:Rostopher: Generalist pick. Gridskipper is the dark horse of Season of the Splicer, a pulse rifle that feels good even to folk who don't like pulses. Multi-Kill Clip and Tunnel Vision feature excellent synergy, and combined with the pulse's zippy fire rate, absolutely melts combatants and guardians alike, with the aim assist boost magnetising bullets to the crit spots of your foes. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Seventh Seraph Carbine
dimwishlist:item=1561006927&perks=1354429876,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: This perk combo on this weapon is excellent. Just make sure you're cracking heads, and you can fire this thing for days, with ramped up damage from Rampage offsetting the somewhat disappointing damage of the archetype at base. Whack on a Rampage Spec from maximum carnage. [Recommended MW: Any]

// The Number
dimwishlist:item=2492081469&perks=2450788523,2458213969,#notes:Rostopher: The Number is an existential crisis of a weapon - existing purely to demonstrate how much better Shadow Price is than it, with it having the same element, and vastly inferior stats than even the basic version of the Nightfall weapon. That said, it can roll perks that Shadow Price cannot, including Multi-Kill Clip which you have here. Killing Wind is the best of a bad bunch, and any combination of barrel and mag perks will work here. [Recommended MW: Any]

A keeper for sure.

dimwishlist:item=875848769&perks=3643424744,#notes:Rostopher: Overflow will feel great on this weapon. The other perks may not be terrific combined with it, but given the wild selection of perks available on this weapon, it may be worth keeping purely on the strength of this perk.

// Bottom Dollar
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=3038247973,#notes:Rostopher: Given the absolutely wild perk pools on this weapon, the fact that you have one with Explosive Payload is pretty good - it's an excellent perk on hand cannons in both PvE and PvP. The other perks might not be great, but this perk carries the weapon a fair way on its own. Try to combo with barrel perks that enhance your stability and handling, and magazine perks that enhance your magazine size or range.

// Code Duello
dimwishlist:item=2496242052&perks=3927722942#notes:Rostopher: PvE DPS pick. As long as you can make sure you're not missing (as this weapon lacks tracking), this offers some of the best sustained DPS of any heavy weapon. Particularly potent when combined with hotswapping, and even more so if someone is running Divinity.  Lasting Impression does a lot of work to make this weapon servicable, so even without the perfect perks in the other slots, this will do work. [Recommended MW: Velocity]

// Cold Front
dimwishlist:item=1506719573&perks=4049631843#notes:Rostopher: Given the rarity of this weapon, if you managed to get one with One for All, consider yourself lucky. Pick barrel and mag perks that enhance either your magazine size, or stablity and range.
dimwishlist:item=1506719573&perks=3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Given the rarity of this weapon, getting on with Rampage on it is a blessing in disguise. Hold on to it, and look for barrel and mag perks that enhance either your magazine size, or stability and range.

// Crowd Pleaser
dimwishlist:item=3565520715&perks=2396489472,#notes:Rostopher: Given the absolutely wild perk pool of this weapon, getting Chain Reaction on this weapon is low-key cool, so you might want to hold onto this until you get a more specialised roll.

dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=2551157718,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Given the wild perk pool on this weapon, you sometimes have to take what you're given, and Box Breathing is a nice consolation prize if you couldn't get Vorpal [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=957782887,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Given the wild perk pool on this weapon, you sometimes have to take what you're given, and Snapshot negates a lot of the downsizes of running an Aggressive Frame sniper. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Given the wild perk pool on this weapon, you sometimes have to take what you're given, and this is one of only a small number of snipers that can roll Vorpal, so this is worth keeping. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Shotgun
dimwishlist:item=11&perks=3300816228,2360754333#notes:Rostopher: Shotguns with Auto-Loading and Trench are, generally, quite good in PvE. Pull it out, punch a guy, then pump out three big-damage shots. Holster it and go back to your day. You want magazine perks that enhance magazine size; or Assault Mag for faster damage output. The only barrel perk you want to avoid with this roll is Full Choke, which reduces precision damage. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Sword
dimwishlist:item=54&perks=1749209109,3913600130#notes:Rostopher: Any sword with Relentless and Whirlwind is worth keeping. Landing light attacks ramps up your damage, and returns ammo, what's not to love? [Recommended MW: Impact]

// Apostate
dimwishlist:item=-2164448701&perks=#notes:Rostopher: The Apostate low-key sucks booty, with mediocre base stats, a bizarre recoil direction and a deeply uninteresting perk pool. I have never once said to myself 'boy I wish I had a rapid-fire arc sniper that looks like something out of Mad Max and only has perks that are useful if I secure kills with it'. There are a couple of decent rolls, but this is not one of them, and honestly, you're better off running almost anything else in its place.

// Bottom Dollar
dimwishlist:item=-1046651176&perks=1820235745,#notes:Rostopher: Subsistence feels extremely poor on 120s without Extended Mag. Unless this is your only one, you'll probably want to bin this.

// Chroma Rush
dimwishlist:item=-1119734784&perks=1820235745,#notes:Rostopher: Subsistence only really works on this weapon when paired with Rampage - otherwise, it just takes so many bullets to get it going that you're not really making the most of the perk.

// Coriolis Force
dimwishlist:item=-3512349612&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Coriolis Force is a tough weapon to love. It recoils naturally almost horizontally to the left (in contrast to most fusions, which recoil slightly to the right and vertically), and is functionally useless in PvP. There are some niche rolls available on it that fit into some very specific builds as a void fusion rifle, but this is not one of those rolls, so only keep if you're doing so for completionist purposes.

// Corsair's Wrath
dimwishlist:item=-2714022207&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Whilst they did receive a buff, Linear Fusions are nowhere near as strong for DPS as rockets, grenade launchers or swords, and Corsair's Wrath has very little going for it to make it shine in its perk pool in PvE. There are some rolls out there that will do work in both PvE and PvP, but this is not one of them. Get it in the bin.

// Death Adder
dimwishlist:item=-2742490609&perks=#notes:Rostopher: Death Adder was supposed to be the chosen one! It was supposed to replace The Recluse, not be left in Darkness! But in all seriousness, god this weapon is just disappointing as hell, with a poor selection of perks. It's only redeeming quality is it's one of only two solar SMGs in the game, so if you need to keep one on that basis, do so. There are also some rolls out there that do work, but this is not one of them, get it in the bin.

// Dire Promise
dimwishlist:item=2742838701&perks=1561002382,47981717,2846385770#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. For a ludicrously consistent neutral hand cannon, look no further. This thing can touch up to nearly 33 meters, has incredibly forgiving aim assistance, and opening shot will magnetise that first shot to your opponents head. An outstanding duelling weapon, definitely worth a keep if you're into PvP. Choose a sight that gives you buffs to either Range or Stability. [Recommended MW: Range]

Given that you are guaranteed to get less than half the magazine on heavy ammo pickup, you've got here a very dangerous weapon in PvP. Dynamic Sway Reduction will help keep you on target. This also features close to max range and stability, to keep you consistent and engaging at any given range in PvP. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Subsistence works terrifically with this meaty magazine - if you have to reload this weapon, you fired it at the wrong enemy. Use it as a red/orange-bar shredder, and pair it with a spec GL or sniper for boss DPS. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Steadyhand goes a long way to offsetting the weapon's inherently poor handling and stability stats, with Accurized and Rangefinder doing the bulk of the work in the range department. Timed Payload is incredibly irritating to fight against, particularly when you're being pinged at the range 120s are capable of.

// Dire Promise
dimwishlist:item=2742838701&perks=3643424744,4082225868,#notes:Rostopher: Dire Promise, the old crucible favourite, has this roll, which is great in PvE. The sights perk doesn't really matter, and the only magazine perk that you should probably avoid is extended, as it makes the reload interminable. Otherwise, focus on stability and handling to get the most out of it in PvE. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=2742838701&perks=47981717,2846385770#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. For a ludicrously consistent neutral hand cannon, look no further.

The poor handling stat is not well offset by the higher than average base aim assistance, with recoil that tends right as compared to the vast majority of other Aggressives, which tend to be left or straight. That said, this roll is, mechanically, very efficient, and if you can get around the poor handling and weird recoil, it's very usable. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=4292849692&perks=4134353779,3400784728,1015611457,#notes:Rostopher: Goofball PvE pick.

Whilst the weapon itself is not as good as other 120s - featuring poorer numbers on nearly every stat including magazine size - this does give it some merit.

dimwishlist:item=1967303408&perks=3513791699,3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: Whilst overall, this weapon is a bit disappointing, it is one of only a handful of weapons that can roll mulligan, and combining this with Rampage does turn it into a bit of a 'hold down the trigger and hope I kill everything in front of me' weapon, which makes it somewhat fun in low-level content.
dimwishlist:item=1967303408&perks=3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: Rampage is literally the only useful perk on column 4 of this weapon, and since you have it, this is probably worth keeping despite its other perks.

// Age-Old Bond
dimwishlist:item=-601592879&perks=#notes:Rostopher: This is sadly just not a great weapon without very specific rolls, and your roll is not one of them. If it's your only one, might as well keep it - otherwise, it's time to run more Last Wishes and do Riven legit, yes?

// Archon's Thunder
dimwishlist:item=-1967303408&perks=#notes:Rostopher: A pretty big disappointment, this one. 360 machine guns really aren't good enough to justify using over 450 or even 900s (which are also bad FYI).

dimwishlist:item=4255586669&perks=960810156,#notes:Rostopher: Given the expansive perk pool on this weapon, the fact that you've snagged one with Danger Zone is at the very least interesting. One of only a few breech GLs that can roll it, this buff to blast radius is not to be sniffed at.
dimwishlist:item=4255586669&perks=3523296417,#notes:Rostopher: Given the expansive perk pool on this weapon, the fact that you've snagged one with Demolitionist is pretty good. Demolitionist pairs really well with breech grenade launchers, allowing you to fire, throw your grenade, then fire again, whilst kills with it will recharge your grenade, so it effectively feeds off itself. Worth keeping until you snag a better one.
dimwishlist:item=4255586669&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: Given the expansive perk pool on this weapon, the fact that you've snagged one with Vorpal Weapon is a minor miracle.

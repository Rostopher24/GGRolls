title:The Moscopher Wishlist
description:This is a compiled list of recommended and god rolls from The Guardian Grill's most annoying stat-whores.

// Accrued Redemption
dimwishlist:item=4095896073&perks=852209214,3827198035,201365942,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: This is the discerning bow-users roll. Buffs to accuracy from the string and arrow perks, alongside the classic Archer's Tempo/Rampage combo. This bow is rare as hell, and this is a perfect roll on it, so whack a rampage spec on it, and keep it. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Age-Old Bond
dimwishlist:item=601592879&perks=1467527085,679225683,1354429876,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Whilst 260 autos aren't exactly optimal weapons, this curated roll works just fine for low-level activities. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Ancient Gospel
dimwishlist:item=48643186&perks=4090651448,106909392,1168162263,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Ancient Gospel is a great little handcannon that'll do work wherever hand cannons are good. This roll is fully min/maxed to do work for you, with Outlaw and Kill Clip providing a lovely synergistic pairing, and Tactical Mag bumping up your magazine size and reducing your reload speed, to minimise your downtime. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=48643186&perks=1482024992,3142289711,699525795,2846385770#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 140s are almost always a competetive pick, particularly if you have the aim to let them sing, and this roll will do work for you at plenty of ranges. Eye of the Storm is an underrated perk for PvP, increasing your bullet magnetism as your health gets lower, which might give you the edge you need in a duel. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Apex Predator
dimwishlist:item=2545083870&perks=3525010810,3796465595,3977735242,3300816228#notes:Rostopher: Apex Predator is the runt of the rocket launcher family. It's perk selection is microscopic, its curated roll is weird at the best of times and it has largely been superceded by Code Duello. However, if you do have this particular roll, this is probably the absolute min-maxed DPS roll you can get, so hold onto it. [Recommended MW: Velocity]

// Apostate
dimwishlist:item=2164448701&perks=3250034553,3142289711,2866798147,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. If you are into 140 sniper rifles in PvP, then this is an extremely solid pick. No Distractions reduces flinch if you ADS for a moment, and combine that with the more or less maxed range and Opening Shot means you'll be able to land surprise snipes in duelling situations. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Arsenic Bite-4b
dimwishlist:item=720351795&perks=852209214,3429800428,3425386926,201365942#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. The OG energy bow, the combo of Archer's Tempo and Rampage is a thing of beauty. Fiberglass Arrows max out your accuracy, and Polymer String gets your draw time down as far as possible, maximising your damage potention. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Astral Horizon
dimwishlist:item=1697682876&perks=1300023272,791862061,3300816228,2360754333#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Not that you'll likely use this weapon in PvE, but if you do happen upon this roll, it does do a fair amount of work. Auto-Loading holster pairs very nicely with Trench Barrell, Assault Mag ramps up your fire rate, and Barrel Shroud gives you the biggest possible bump to handling, making sure you can whip it out quickly. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=1697682876&perks=1332244541,3142289711,3436462433,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Maximised range, bonus accuracy on the first shot of your attack, and a bump to handling from Surplus. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Astral Horizon (Adept)
dimwishlist:item=532746994&perks=1300023272,791862061,3300816228,2360754333#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Not that you'll likely use this weapon in PvE, but if you do happen upon this roll, it does do a fair amount of work. Auto-Loading holster pairs very nicely with Trench Barrell, Assault Mag ramps up your fire rate, and Barrel Shroud gives you the biggest possible bump to handling, making sure you can whip it out quickly. [Recommended MW: Handling]
dimwishlist:item=532746994&perks=1332244541,3142289711,3436462433,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Maximised range, bonus accuracy on the first shot of your attack, and a bump to handling from Surplus. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Avalanche
dimwishlist:item=66875353&perks=1561002382,2450788523,1890422124#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Avalanche may look like a slightly mishapen potato, but as machine guns go, this thing will do work. Killing Wind will push your range out and give you the zoomies, tap the trigger keeps you honest with your recoil, and High-Cal rounds will flinch off even the most persistent of snipers. Scopes on this thing really come down to personal preference, so use whichever one you like best. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Bad Omens
dimwishlist:item=991314988&perks=1478423395,3796465595,3977735242,1275731761#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Bad Omens is a lovely rocket launcher that has, sadly been largely superceded by the superior Royal Entry. That said, this roll will be entirely functional at Blowing Shit Up™.  This is also the curated roll, so always worth hanging on to it. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Bequest
dimwishlist:item=3366545721&perks=3666208348,269888150,1749209109,354401740#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Holding the dubious honour of 'Perhaps most disappointing raid weapon', Bequest is a weapon that is very much style over substance. That said, Relentless Strikes and Assassin's Blade will be entirely functional in low-end content. Swordmaster's gets your heavy attack back faster, and Jagged Edge maximises your damage potential. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Berenger's Memory
dimwishlist:item=407621213&perks=3301904089,2869569095,3300816228,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Berenger's sits in an odd place, in that it's a rapid fire frame, so your mileage with it may vary. Spike/Auto-Loading/Field Prep, however, is a snappy PvE roll that'll work in almost any situation, with the extra reserves and fast reload on demand from Field Prep being particularly welcome. The barrel perk doesn't really make much of a difference, but try to maximise handling and blast radius. [Recommended MW: Blast Radius]
dimwishlist:item=407621213&perks=3301904089,2869569095,3523296417,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Berenger's sits in an odd place, in that it's a rapid fire frame, so your mileage with it may vary. Spike/Demolitionist/Field Prep, however, is a snappy PvE roll that'll work in almost any situation. Just remember, you can reload by yeeting a grenade - use this to your advantage. The barrel perk doesn't really make much of a difference, but try to maximise handling and blast radius. [Recommended MW: Blast Radius]
dimwishlist:item=407621213&perks=3301904089,706527188,3300816228,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Berenger's sits in an odd place, in that it's a rapid fire frame, so your mileage with it may vary. Spike/Auto-Loading/Quickdraw, however, is a snappy PvE roll that'll work in almost any situation. The barrel perk doesn't really make much of a difference, but try to maximise handling and blast radius. [Recommended MW: Blast Radius]

// Bite of the Fox
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=4090651448,3142289711,957782887,588594999#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat cotentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=4090651448,3142289711,957782887,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat cotentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=1840239774,1087426260,247725512,2869569095#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst you probably have better PvE snipers than this, this roll will work in a variety of situations. Just remember to crouch when you reload. [Recommended MW: Reload]
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=3250034553,3142289711,957782887,588594999#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat cotentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3169616514&perks=3250034553,3142289711,957782887,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Whilst the sights are somewhat cotentious, if you can get used to them, this roll absolutely slaps in PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Biting Winds
dimwishlist:item=1621657423&perks=852209214,3827198035,2450788523,3350417888#notes:Rostopher: Biting Winds is a bit of an odd duck in the bow department. It's the only bow that cannot roll with Archer's Tempo, and so we must look elsewhere for utility. Killing Wind is rather good on pretty much everything, and Sympathetic Arsenal was designed for bows, given that you are always 'reloading' it when you nock an arrow. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]
dimwishlist:item=1621657423&perks=852209214,3827198035,247725512,4082225868#notes:Rostopher: Biting Winds is a bit of an odd duck in the bow department. It's the only bow that cannot roll with Archer's Tempo, and Rapid Hit feels like a poor replacement. However, this roll still gets the jop done, and as a bonus, you can punch a guy for a big stack of damage boost. [Recommended MW: Draw Time]

// Blasphemer
dimwishlist:item=2782847179&perks=3250034553,3142289711,706527188,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. The curated roll of this weapon is a monstrous contender in PvP. If you like slug shotguns therein, you'll like this one. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Bottom Dollar
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=4090651448,106909392,1168162263,2458213969#notes:Rostopher: God tier roll here. Corkscrew Rifling gives you a flat buff to 3 stats with no downsides; Tac Mag gives you an extra bullet and a bonus to reload and stability; and Outlaw/Multi-Kill Clip is a perfectly synergistic 3rd and 4th. This thing hits like a train in both PvE and PvP. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=1046651176&perks=3250034553,3142289711,2450788523,47981717#notes:Rostopher: An insane max-range roll for PvP here. You're sacrificing a damage perk for Opening Shot, but if you can combine it with High Energy Fire or other damage buffs, this thing has insane two-tap range, and is outrageously consistent in duels. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Brass Attacks
dimwishlist:item=2121785039&perks=4090651448,1885400500,2450788523,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Aggressive Burst sidearms are hugely underrated in PvP, and Brass Attacks with this roll absolutely slaps. Rampage lowers your already ridiculously low TTK, and Killing Wind lets you compete at nearly auto-rifle ranges. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// BrayTech Werewolf
dimwishlist:item=528834068&perks=3250034553,1968497646,2387244414,2458213969#notes:Rostopher: This is the curated roll of this weapon, and is extremely reliable in both PvE and PvP. Hold onto this if you managed to snag it. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=528834068&perks=1482024992,1885400500,1359896290,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: Oddball PvP pick. Vorpal Weapon is great in PvP, and this weapon will keep you on target for long enough to absolutely mince enemy supers. Combine with High Energy fire for maximum carnage. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Chattering Bone
dimwishlist:item=568515759&perks=4090651448,679225683,1015611457,2213355989#notes:Rostopher: This is the curated roll of this weapon, and it works very well in both PvP and PvP. Hold onto it if you got it. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=568515759&perks=4090651448,1885400500,1168162263,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Whilst Lightweight Frames suffer in the DPS department compared to other pulse rifles, this roll covers a lot of the defecits that come with them. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Chroma Rush
dimwishlist:item=1119734784&perks=4090651448,3142289711,1359896290,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 720s are deeply underrated in PvP, with a not unimpressive .77 TTK. Corkscrew and Accurized will push your range out to 23 meters, and Dynamic Sway will keep the weapon from bouncing around too hard. Proccing Kill Clip will drop your TTK to .60 for the duration, so is not to be sniffed at. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1119734784&perks=4090651448,3142289711,2946784966,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 720s are deeply underrated in PvP, with a not unimpressive .77 TTK. Corkscrew and Accurized will push your range out to 23 meters. Kill Clip and Tunnel Vision are curiously synergistic, proccing on reloading after a kill, so you can just beam the next guy after securing a kill. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1119734784&perks=4090651448,106909392,2779035018,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Feeding Frenzy + Kill Clip is a lovely synergistic combo, giving you a huge bump to your already impressive DPS on this weapon. The flat buff to 3 stats from Corkscrew Rifling will keep the weapon under control, and Tactical Mag is always a great option on more or less any weapon. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=1119734784&perks=1392496348,1431678320,1820235745,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Subsistence + Rampage is a quintessential add-clearing pick, and the massive magazine on this weapon means as long as your focusing on red-bars, you may never need to reload. Alloy Mag gives a lovely snappy reload if you do hit the bottom of the mag, and Polygonal's stability bump is a super welcome bump to the weapon's controllability. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=1119734784&perks=1392496348,106909392,1820235745,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Subsistence + Rampage is a quintessential add-clearing pick, and the massive magazine on this weapon means as long as your focusing on red-bars, you may never need to reload. Tac Mag maximises your magazine without penalising you if you did hit the bottom of the mag, and Polygonal's stability bump is a super welcome bump to the weapon's controllability. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Code Duello
dimwishlist:item=2496242052&perks=3525010810,3796465595,3300816228,3927722942#notes:Rostopher: PvE DPS pick. As long as you can make sure you're not missing (as this weapon lacks tracking), this offers some of the best sustained DPS of any heavy weapon. Particularly potent when combined with hotswapping, and even more so if someone is running Divinity. [Recommended MW: Velocity]

// Cold Denial
dimwishlist:item=1216130969&perks=839105230,3230963543,2779035018,2458213969#notes:Rostopher: Generalist pick. Whilst this weapon is cumbersome at the best of times, this set of perks is a great combo assuming you can get to grips with the poor handling and odd scope. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Commemoration
dimwishlist:item=4230965989&perks=839105230,3142289711,1359896290,588594999#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. 450 machine guns are the go-to for PvP, and this roll makes sure you keep on target, keeping the recoil under control, pushing the range out to pretty close to maximum, and bumping your aim assist whilst moving. [Recommended MW: Stability]
dimwishlist:item=4230965989&perks=2420895100,1523832109,3425386926,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Reconstruction turns this weapon from 'another machine gun' into something special. Extended mag means you can have up to 146 bullets in a magazine, which is, y'know, insane. Rampage is the best of a bad bunch of machine guns in column 4, and the barrel perks don't really make much impact on how you'll use this weapon. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Crimil's Dagger
dimwishlist:item=4292849692&perks=1926090095,106909392,1168162263,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: Hakke hand cannons… they kinda just feel bad. The poor handling stat is not well offset by the higher than average base aim assistance, with recoil that tends right as compared to the vast majority of other Aggressives, which tend to be left or straight. That said, this roll is, mechanically, very efficient, and if you can get around the poor handling and weird recoil, it's very usable. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Dead Man's Tale
dimwishlist:item=3654674561&perks=4090651448,3142289711,1546637391,4259401308#notes:Rostopher: PvP/Generalist S-tier roll. Vorpal is exceptional on this weapon, turning it into a Super-melting machine in PvP, and performing really well in PvE, particularly in higher-end content when Scout Rifles are in the Champion meta. This roll maximises range without sacrificing handling, keeping the weapon snappy whilst pushing out the aim assist on the hip fire as far as possible. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3654674561&perks=4090651448,1968497646,1354429876,3465198467#notes:Rostopher: PvE S-tier roll - Fourth Time's synergises perfectly with Dead Man's exotic perk, letting you fire a total of 22 rounds before needing to reload, as long as you're nailing all precision hits. Corkscrew rifling and Composite Stock are probably best in slot options, and Armour Piercing does more damage to shields when you need it to. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Dire Promise
dimwishlist:item=2742838701&perks=1926090095,1885400500,47981717,2846385770#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. This roll will feel SUPER snappy, and will hit close to 140's range cap when ADS thanks to rangefinder. Ricochet for the cheeky range and stablity buff, and steadyhand to keep the stability in check.  [Recommended MW: Range]

// Falling Guillotine
dimwishlist:item=614426548&perks=3666208348,269888150,1749209109,3913600130#notes:Rostopher: This is just the bestest sword. [Recommended MW: Impact]

// False Promises
dimwishlist:item=3143732432&perks=839105230,3230963543,3643424744,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: This is a great roll on a not great weapon. High Impacts fire bullets and that's all that can really be said of them. That said, this roll is fun enough to run in strikes if you're looking for something to mix things up. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// Friction Fire
dimwishlist:item=1513993763&perks=4090651448,3230963543,2450788523,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Friction Fire is largely outclassed by other kinetic SMGs (particularly Extraordinary Rendition), thanks to it's thunderous handling and slow reload speed, but Killing Wind/Rampage works very well on it, and is worth a sniff. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=1513993763&perks=4090651448,3230963543,1820235745,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Friction Fire is largely outclassed by other kinetic SMGs (particularly Extraordinary Rendition), thanks to it's thunderous handling and slow reload speed, but Subsistence/Rampage works very well on it, and is worth a sniff. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Frozen Orbit
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=1840239774,3142289711,588594999,957782887#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. This roll maximises range, without sacrificing handling, and snapshot sights will offset the slow ADS speed, allowing you to nail those quickscopes. [Recommended MW: Range]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=1840239774,1087426260,3300816228,706527188#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Auto-Loading/Quickdraw is a nice perk combo, particularly for moments were you need to do a quick burst of DPS. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=1840239774,1087426260,3300816228,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Auto-Loading/Vorpal is a nice perk combo, particularly for moments were you need to do a quick burst of DPS. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=1840239774,2420895100,3400784728,1546637391#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Triple Tap/Vorpal is a nice perk combo for when you need some sustained DPS. Extended Mag needs combined with the Backup Mag mod, giving you 5 in the chamber, and allowing you to fire up to 7 shots as long as you nail your precision hits. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=3250034553,3142289711,588594999,47981717#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Assuming you are comfotable with hard-scoping, rather than needing to quickscope, this roll has ungodly levels of aim assistance on the first shot fired. Maximised range pushes your aim assistance cone out as far as possible. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Gridskipper
dimwishlist:item=1621558458&perks=4090651448,679225683,2946784966,2458213969#notes:Rostopher: Generalist pick. My personal roll of this weapon, and ho boy does it slap. Corkscrew Rifling does a nice flat buff to handling, stability and range, Light Mag keeps the reload snappy and pushes out your range; and Tunnel Vision locks your high-damage shots from Multi-Kill Clip onto the heads of your enemies. Thoroughly recommend, even if you don't like pulse rifles. [Recommended MW: Stability]

// IKELOS_SMG_v1.0.2
dimwishlist:item=2222560548&perks=4090651448,1140096971,1631667848,3523296417#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. The 'Gravy Roll', this weapon has excellent utility, with not 1, not 2, but 3 different ways to reload it (manual, melee kill, throw grenade). Seraph Rounds do bonus stagger damage against combatants, and Corkscrew Rifling is a nice flat buff to 3 stats. [Recommended MW: Range]

// Night Watch
dimwishlist:item=3504336176&perks=4090651448,2420895100,3643424744,3038247973#notes:Rostopher: This is the curated roll of this weapon, and it only drops from the New Light campaign, or from Gambit Prime/The Reckoning back when those were in the game. Do not get rid of this; it's not only rare, it's an extremely fun weapon to use. Hip fire for maximum AC-130 vibes. [Recommended MW: Handling]

// Royal Entry
dimwishlist:item=2448907086&perks=1478423395,1996142143,3300816228,1275731761#notes:Rostopher: Auto-loading Holster is always strong on rockets, and Cluster Bomb combined with Black Powder makes sure you cover the widest possible area with explosions. Combine this with the intrinsic tracking of this frame, and it's a great 'oh shit' rocket that you can whip out, blow a bunch of stuff out, then put away and continue on with your business. [Recommended MW: Blast Radius]

// Seventh Seraph Carbine
dimwishlist:item=1561006927&perks=839105230,1885400500,1354429876,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: This is my personal god roll of this weapon, and I love it deeply. Arrowhead Brake makes the recoil perfectly vertical, Ricochet Rounds gives you a nice Stability and Range buff; and FTTC and Rampage synergise rather well, particular with Rampage Spec equipped.

Multi-Kill Clip is surprisingly effective on 600s, even with just one stack. Dynamic sway reduction keeps your bullets on target, and accurized lets you hit at unexpected ranges for an AR.

Feeding Frenzy and MKC synergise nicely, so this would be an all-round extremely solid roll for PvE. [Recommended MW: Stability]

That said, this roll is extremely functional, and will work well in both PvE and PvP if you care to use it. [Recommended MW: Stability]

Killing Wind and Rampage is a really great combo, as KW makes Rampage feel like it really kicks in, as you not only gain the damage buff, but also a range buff, and your gain the proverbial zoomies. Whilst the base of 10 in the mag is fine, Appended gets you up to 2 with no penalty to reload speed (and allowing you to run Rampage spec), and Smallbore is an always welcome flat buff to Stability and Range.

Quickdraw means you can get it out fast in a tight spot, and Rangefinder more or less makes the weapon hit the range cap for 140s when aiming down sights. Hi-Cal gives you a nice buff to range, and some extra flinch, and Corkscrew Rifling gives a flat buff to handling, range and stability. [Recommended MW: Stability]

These burst side arms are absolutely monstrous in PvE, and with One for All, as long as you're comfortable proccing it, it ramps the damage up by 35%. Ambitious Assassin will get you just so many bullets in the mag. Combine with Tac Mag and Shortspec for flat buffs to almost every stat, this will be an extremely reliable sidearm.

These burst sidearms are excellent in both PvE and PvP, with an extraordinary damage output within their range.

This is a classic bow roll - nailing headshots makes you fire more arrows, and Swashbuckler is a great replacement for Rampage. It works a treat. Plus, it sounds terrific when it looses.

Whilst Bonechiller isn't as highly regarded as First In, Last Out or Blasphemer in PvP, this roll will work exceptionally well, particularly if you’re a sliding shotgun ape. Firmly Planted kicks in when you slide, then combines with the max range and opening shot to get unreasonably accurate murder. [Recommended MW: Handling]

dimwishlist:item=3654674561&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: PvP/Generalist roll. Vorpal  is exceptional on this weapon, turning it into a Super-melting machine in PvP, and performing really well in PvE, particularly in higher-end content when Scout Rifles are in the Champion meta. Just Vorpal makes this weapon stand out, regardless of the rest of your perks, but a better roll is available if you care to keep grinding. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Deafening Whisper
dimwishlist:item=981718087&perks=3300816228,#notes:Rostopher: Auto-Loading Holster on this weapon is great, and the weapon is strong enough despite its weird perk pool that this will carry it almost entirely. [Recommended MW: Any]

dimwishlist:item=2742838701&perks=3643424744,4082225868,#notes:Rostopher: Dire Promise, the old crucible favourite, has this roll, which is great in PvE.

Gridskipper is the dark horse of Season of the Splicer, a pulse rifle that feels good even to folk who don't like pulses. Multi-Kill Clip and Tunnel Vision feature excellent synergy, and combined with the pulse's zippy fire rate, absolutely melts combatants and guardians alike, with the aim assist boost magnetising bullets to the crit spots of your foes.

// Code Duello
dimwishlist:item=2496242052&perks=3927722942#notes:Rostopher: PvE DPS pick. As long as you can make sure you're not missing (as this weapon lacks tracking), this offers some of the best sustained DPS of any heavy weapon. Particularly potent when combined with hotswapping, and even more so if someone is running Divinity.  Lasting Impression does a lot of work to make this weapon servicable, so even without the perfect perks in the other slots, this will do work. [Recommended MW: Velocity]

// Frozen Orbit
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=2551157718,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Given the wild perk pool on this weapon, you sometimes have to take what you're given, and Box Breathing is a nice consolation prize if you couldn't get Vorpal [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=957782887,#notes:Rostopher: PvP pick. Given the wild perk pool on this weapon, you sometimes have to take what you're given, and Snapshot negates a lot of the downsizes of running an Aggressive Frame sniper. [Recommended MW: Any]
dimwishlist:item=3473290087&perks=1546637391,#notes:Rostopher: PvE pick. Given the wild perk pool on this weapon, you sometimes have to take what you're given, and this is one of only a small number of snipers that can roll Vorpal, so this is worth keeping. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Hand Cannon
dimwishlist:item=6&perks=2779035018,1015611457#notes:Rostopher: Reload speed perk + reload activated damage perk = profit. [Recommended MW: Any]

dimwishlist:item=6&perks=1168162263,3425386926#notes:Rostopher: Outlaw Rampage is a classic perk combo on Hand Cannons, you can't really go wrong with it! [Recommended MW: Range]

// Shotgun
dimwishlist:item=11&perks=3300816228,2360754333#notes:Rostopher: Shotguns with Auto-Loading and Trench are, generally, quite good in PvE. Pull it out, punch a guy, then pump out three big-damage shots. Holster it and go back to your day. You want magazine perks that enhance magazine size; or Assault Mag for faster damage output. The only barrel perk you want to avoid with this roll is Full Choke, which reduces precision damage. [Recommended MW: Any]

// Sword
dimwishlist:item=54&perks=1749209109,3913600130#notes:Rostopher: Any sword with Relentless and Whirlwind is worth keeping. Landing light attacks ramps up your damage, and returns ammo, what's not to love? [Recommended MW: Impact]
